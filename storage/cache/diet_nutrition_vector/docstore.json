Lab Podcast #99 \nMy guest this episode is Chris Palmer, M.D., a board-certified psychiatrist and assistant \nprofessor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. He explains the important connection \nbetween nutrition, metabolism and mental health and his pioneering work using the \nketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including \ndepression and schizophrenia. Dr. Palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an \nevidenced-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset the \ncognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s. He describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental \nhealth, how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, and how low-\ncarbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental health. He also \nexplains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight \nloss, important risk factors for mitochondrial health such as marijuana and alcohol, and \nthe best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs. We also \ncover how a ketogenic diet impacts mood, sleep, and fertility. Dr. Palmer\u2019s work stands \nas a revolutionary approach to mental health and disease that, given the prevalence of \nmental health challenges, should be of interest to people of all backgrounds and ages. \n \nThank you to our sponsors \nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/Huberman \nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman

[MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew \nHuberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of \nMedicine. Today, my guest is Dr. Chris Palmer. Dr. Chris Palmer is a medical doctor \nspecializing in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. He is the world expert in the \nrelationship between metabolic disorders and psychiatric disorders. He treats a variety of \ndifferent conditions, including psychosis, including schizophrenia, as well as attention \ndeficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders, and \ndepression among others. He is best known for understanding the relationship between \nhow metabolism and these various disorders of the mind interact.

He describes some remarkable case studies of \nindividuals and groups of people who have achieved tremendous relief from the types of \npsychiatric disorders that I just mentioned a few moments ago, as well as new and \nemerging themes as to how metabolism and the mind interact to control things like \nobesity. Indeed, he raises the hypothesis that perhaps obesity, in many cases, is the \nconsequence of a brain dysfunction as opposed to the consequence of a metabolic \ndysfunction that then impacts the brain. During today's episode, he shares with us his \noverriding hypotheses about the critical roles that mitochondrial function and dysfunction \nplay in mental health and mental illness, and how various particular types of diets-- \nranging from the ketogenic diet to modified ketogenic diet and even just slight \nadjustments in carbohydrate intake-- can be used in order to change mitochondrial \nfunction and bring relief for various psychiatric illnesses. He also highlights the essential \nand important theme that various diet interventions, including the ketogenic diet, were \nnot first developed for sake of weight loss but rather were developed as treatments for \nneurologic conditions, such as epilepsy. Today, he shares with us how the foods that we \neat alone and in combination, and how fasting-- both intermittent fasting and more \nlengthy fasts-- can interact with the way that our brain functions to strongly control the \nway that we think, feel, and behave. What's wonderful is that Dr. Palmer not only \nexplains the science and his clinical expertise, but also points to various actionable \nmeasures that people can take in order to improve their mental health. I'd like to mention \nthat Dr. Palmer is also the author of a terrific new book. The title is Brain Energy: A \nRevolutionary Breakthrough in Understanding Mental Health and Improving Treatment \nfor Anxiety, Depression, OCD, PTSD and More. I've read the book, and it is a terrific \nread. I came away from this book with a much evolved understanding of how the various \npsychiatric disorders that I just described, as well as ADHD, emerge in people. And it \nhas completely revised my understanding about the possible origins of various \npsychiatric disorders and the best ways to treat them, including both with medications \nbut also with nutritional approaches.

Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that \nthis podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, \npart of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science \nand science-related tools for the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to \nthank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Thesis. Thesis makes custom \nnootropics. And as I've said many times before on this podcast, I am not a fan of the \nword \"nootropics\" because it means smart drugs. And frankly, there are no specific \nneural circuits in the brain or body for being, quote unquote, \"smart.\" Thesis understands \nthis. And they've developed custom nootropics that are designed to bring your brain and \nbody into the state that's ideal for what you need to accomplish. They use the highest \nquality ingredients, things like phosphatidylserine, alpha GPC, many ingredients that I've \ntalked about before on this podcast and that I happen to use myself. I've been using \nThesis for over a year now. And I can confidently say that their nootropics have been a \ngame changer. For me, I like their nootropic for clarity. I use that before cognitive work \noften. And I like their nootropic for energy, and I often use that before workouts-- in \nparticular, workouts that are especially intense. To get your own personalized nootropic \nstarter kit, go online to takethesis.com/huberman. Take their 3-minute quiz, and Thesis \nwill send you four different formulas to try in your first month.

Eight Sleep makes smart \nmattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've talked many \ntimes on this podcast about the critical relationship between sleep and body \ntemperature. That is, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep throughout the night, \nour body temperature needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And conversely, when we \nwake up in the morning, that is, in large part, because of our body heating up by 1 to 3 \ndegrees. Now, people have different core body temperatures. And they tend to run \ncolder or hotter throughout the night. Eight Sleep allows you to adjust the temperature of \nyour sleeping environment so that you have the optimal temperature that gets you the \nbest night's sleep. I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover about eight \nmonths ago, and it has completely transformed my sleep. I sleep so much deeper. I \nwake up far less during the middle of the night, if at all. And I wake up feeling far better \nthan I ever have even after the same amount of sleep.

The company \nwas founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford. And everything about ROKA \neyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind. I've spent a \nlifetime working on the biology, the visual system. And I can tell you that your visual \nsystem has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to see \nclearly-- for instance, when you move from a sunny area to a shady area and back \nagain, whether or not you're looking at something up close or often to the distance. \nROKA understands the biology of the visual system and has designed their eyeglasses \nand sunglasses accordingly so that you always see with perfect clarity. ROKA \neyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed for activities such as running and \ncycling. And indeed, they are very lightweight. Most of the time I can't even remember \nthat they're on my face. They're so lightweight. But the important thing to know about \nROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses is that while they can be used during sports activities, \nthey also have a terrific aesthetic. And they can be used just as well for wearing to work \nor out to dinner, et cetera.

Chris, Dr. Palmer, thank \nyou for being here. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, for having me. ANDREW \nHUBERMAN: I have a lot of questions for you. And I'm really excited about this topic \nbecause I think most people know what mental illness is-- or they have some idea what \nthat is. Most people have some idea what nutrition is. Fewer people certainly know how \nclosely those things can interact. And I think everybody is familiar with the feeling of a \nfood or the ingestion of a food making them feel good in the short term. When we eat a \nfood that tastes delicious to us or that we associate with something nice, then we feel \ngood mentally and physically. Whereas, when we eat something that gives us food \npoisoning or maybe even something that just doesn't taste that great or that we \nassociate with a bad experience, we feel less good in the short term. But I believe that \nvery few people understand or are familiar with the fact that nutrition and our mental", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2714, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef8d9444-cca2-4d0f-98f5-88f058b2e1ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef8d9444-cca2-4d0f-98f5-88f058b2e1ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "99_Dr_Chris_Palmer_Diet_&_Nutrition_for_Mental_Health_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_99.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "92fb601a-08f8-41f6-9e41-45a4b9e0e42d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "99_Dr_Chris_Palmer_Diet_&_Nutrition_for_Mental_Health_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_99.pdf"}, "hash": "702cb9cdddd54a4547b0dbc9e683bdde15d4b4f3e391a6eb534ab55fdd780727", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com \nhealth interact in this very intimate, maybe even causal, way and that is something that \noccurs over long periods of time. Meaning, what I ate yesterday or the day before, \nmaybe even 10 years ago, could be impacting the way that my brain and body are \nmaking me feel now. So if you would, I'd love for you to just tell us about a little bit of the \nhistory, in particular, your history with exploring the relationship between nutrition and \nmental health. And then we can dive into some of the more particulars of ketogenic diets \nversus other diets, and some of the truly miraculous findings that you and others are \ncoming up with based on real patients and real experiences of people who suffer and \nthen find relief by altering their nutrition. CHRIS PALMER: Sure. This story really starts \nwith my own personal story. And I don't need to go into great detail. But to set the stage, \nwhen I was a kid, I definitely had mental illness, started with OCD. A series of events \nhappened in my family. My mother had a horrible kind of psychotic break, and all sorts of \nadverse childhood events for me. She and I were actually homeless together for a while. \nI went on to have subsequent depression, suicidality, all sorts of things. But somehow or \nanother, I pulled myself together and got through medical school-- actually did quite well \nin medical school, got an award for being one of the top students, and then was doing \nmy internship and residency at Harvard. And at that point in time, I was diagnosed with \nmetabolic syndrome. So I had high blood pressure, horrible lipids, and pre-diabetes. And \nI was doing everything right supposedly. I was on a low-fat diet, and I was exercising \nregularly. And year after year, my doctor kept telling me diet and exercise. I kept asking \nhim, what diet? What exercise? I was doing everything he kept telling me to do. \nEverything was getting worse. My blood pressure kept going higher. And at some point, \nhe kind of said, you're going to have to go on medication. I need to put you on \nsomething for your pre-diabetes, something for your cholesterol, and something for your \nblood pressure. So three pills out of the gate. And I'm like, I'm only in my 20s. ANDREW \nHUBERMAN: Were you overweight? CHRIS PALMER: No. Technically, no. I had a gut, \nso that's a sign of insulin resistance, I know now. I didn't know it then. And he actually \nkind of leaned in at one point and said, do your parents have diabetes? Yeah. Do your \nparents have high blood pressure? Yeah. Are your parents overweight? Yeah. Oh, I'm \nreally sorry, it's genetic. Basically, you're screwed. It's your genes. You're just going to \nhave to bite the bullet and take meds. And as a physician, I knew what that meant. I \nknew that I'm in my 20s, if I'm already on three meds for metabolic syndrome, I'm going \nto be screwed by the time I'm 40 or 50. And I'm probably going to be having heart \nattacks.

I actually didn't really believe it. I was \nhighly skeptical. And I believed everything I was taught in medical school. Why would my \nprofessors lie to me? They knew what they were talking about. Low-fat diet was the thing \nto do. And the Atkins diet was clearly dangerous and reckless. But I had been trying the \nmedical dogma for years, and it wasn't working for me. And so for whatever reason, I \ndecided this is going to be my last attempt at something different. And then I'll just bite \nthe bullet and go on meds. So I tried the Atkins diet. I did my own special version of it. I \nstill avoided red meat because I was terrified of red meat. I tried to do a healthy version, \nwhich it's probably more like the South Beach diet. This was before the South Beach \nDiet was invented. But within three months, my metabolic syndrome was completely \ngone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So blood pressure normalized, lipids normalized. Did \nyour weight change? You mentioned that you were of healthy weight but that you had a \nbit of abdominal-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --fat. CHRIS \nPALMER: I lost the abdominal fat. I probably lost about 10 pounds through this process. \nBut everything got normal. And when I went back to my doctor, he was shocked. He \nactually said, what the hell are you doing? ANDREW HUBERMAN: During the time \nbefore you switched to this new diet, how was your mental health, if you don't mind me \nasking? Because it sound like you're very clear that there was metabolic syndrome or \nyou were headed towards more severe metabolic syndrome. You mentioned OCD. I \nactually am familiar with this. As a kid, I had a low level kind of Tourette's grunt. And \nprobably me, obsessive still to some extent-- although not full-blown clinically diagnosed \nOCD, so I can relate somewhat. If you're willing, what was the context of all that before \nand after this nutritional switch? CHRIS PALMER: So before the nutritional switch, I was \nstill struggling with low grade depression and OCD. Again, it wasn't necessarily \ninterfering with my ability to function because I was functioning at a high level. Anybody \nlooking from the outside, you're a top student. You just got into one of the most \ncompetitive-- actually, at that point, it was the most competitive residency program in the \ncountry for psychiatry. So they would have looked at me and said, you're fine. But I \nwasn't. I was actually on medications. I was trying different medications, trying to figure \nout how to feel better, how to stop obsessing so much, how to not be so depressed. And \nI found that those medications, they actually came with more side effects for me than \nbenefits. I was on Prozac for a long time. It totally messed up my sleep.

And so I was taking my pills. I was in psychotherapy. I had \nbeen in psychotherapy on and off for years. I had received much more intensive \ntreatment when I was younger. And that was essentially worthless for me. It actually \nprobably just caused harm at the end of the day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: \nPsychoanalysis? CHRIS PALMER: Various psychotherapies-- not psychoanalysis per \nse, but some of them were psychoanalytically-oriented psychotherapies. I was actually \nhospitalized at one point. I had been put on lithium and imipramine, which is a tricyclic \nantidepressant, and other things. And they were actually horrible. They were horrible. \nThey did nothing beneficial for me. I gave them a decent amount of time to work. I really \nwanted to feel better. So at the time that I tried this diet, I certainly wasn't impaired in the \nsame way. I wasn't struggling that much. But I was-- still have these low grade \nsymptoms, was trying to feel better. And the thing that was the most striking to me, after \ndoing the diet for three months, was not the fact that my metabolic syndrome was gone. \nThat was my goal, and it was a seemingly miraculous achievement because I got rid of \neverything with one dietary change. But the thing that I noticed was dramatic \nimprovement in my mood, energy, concentration, and sleep. I-- for the first time in my \nlife, I started waking up before my alarm went off and feeling rested. That never \nhappened to me before. I was meticulous about planning when my alarm went off and \nhow many times I could push the snooze button in order to be on time for wherever I \nneeded to be, whether it was school or the hospital or whatever. I had it. I had this good \nsystem. I was never late for anything. But that was shocking to me, that I felt so good. \nAnd one of the things that I've often said to people, prior to the diet, I always felt like \nthere are two types of people in the world. There are \"haves\" and \"have-nots.\" There are \nthese happy, peppy people, who just are so positive, and they've got energy. And they \nhave the saying, they like to work hard and play hard. And I always understood working \nhard. I totally got that because I was a hard worker and I understood the value of hard \nwork. And you got to do something useful with yourself. But I never understood who the \nhell wants to play hard, like who's got energy for that? Aren't you tired from working so \nhard? How on Earth do these people have energy to go and play hard?

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whereas, the \nrest-- and by the way, I really appreciate you sharing some of your personal story \nbecause I think it is very important for people to hear and understand that people like \nyourself, who are extremely high functioning and accomplished, that the road was-- from \neverything I'm hearing and understanding-- very choppy internally at times, and that \nyou've overcome a lot in order to get there. And also, have been going through what \nsounds like a very long iterative process of trying to figure out what works and what \ndoesn't work to finally arrive at a solution, and then make that the basis of much of the \nwork that you're doing today for other people. I think it's very important because I think \nmany people share with you this notion that there are indeed two groups-- a happy \ngroup and then fated-to-be unhappy group. And it speaks to the fact that-- your story, \nrather, speaks to the fact that what we see is not always what's going on internally with \npeople and that this notion of there just being two groups-- the happy or the haves and \nthe have-nots-- can't be the way that it works, and there are probably many more people \nsuffering than we realize, and that there is an important need for tools to overcome that \nsuffering. So I really just hear you. Even early in our discussion, I just want to extend a \ngenuine thanks because so much of what I hear from people is questions about health, \nand mental health, and physical health. But that clearly point to the fact that many \npeople are struggling to varying degrees. And even the people who are in this category \nof great childhood and happiness could do far better  \n \n00:20:43 Low-Carb Diets & Anti-Depression, Fasting, Ketosis \n \nfor themselves and then also for other people.

I'm just-- I'm having \nturkey and green beans. And that's good enough for me.

So within a few years, the primary thing I noticed is this powerful \nantidepressant effect. And now, I'm an attending physician. I've got all these patients in \nmy clinical practice with treatment resistant mental illness. I'm in a tertiary care hospital. \nSo I almost never get somebody off the street with their first episode of depression. Out \nof the gate, as part of my career, I get treatment resistant mental disorders. So I get \npeople who've already been to 6-plus psychiatrists, therapists. They've usually tried \ndozens of different medications. They've been in decades of psychotherapy. They've \noften had ECT and other things. And nothing's working. And I'm thinking, well, we're kind \nof out of options for these other people. And this diet is having this really powerful \nantidepressant effect. I think I'm going to try it and just see if any of my patients are \ngame to try it to see if it might help them. Sure enough, it did. Didn't help everyone and \nnot everybody was interested and/or able to do it. But some of the ones who were able \nto do it ended up having a remarkable and powerful antidepressant effect. One woman \nactually became hypomanic within a month. And she had been depressed pretty much \nnonstop for over five years-- chronically depressed, suicidal, in and out of hospitals. And \nI saw her become hypomanic. And I'm thinking, wow, this really is a powerful \nantidepressant effect. This is amazing.

And so I really actually felt like I'm on the fringe \nhere. And this is not going to be met with praise by anyone. So I'm just going to lay low. \nI'm going to offer it to patients.

Any observations or maybe even data? CHRIS \nPALMER: So early on, I was winging it. And I was-- the first few patients, it was try this \nAtkins diet. I want to see ketosis, so I was going for ketones. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So \nthey were pricking their finger, and they were doing a blood ketone test? CHRIS \nPALMER: I didn't know about blood ketone monitors if they existed back then. So I was-- \nwe were using urine strips. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which are not quite as accurate but \nstill useful as a general guide, from what I understand. CHRIS PALMER: True. \nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW \nHUBERMAN: OK. CHRIS PALMER: So I was strongly recommending that patients \nachieve urinary ketosis. And the interesting thing is I noticed a pattern, that when they \nwere trying the diet and not getting ketones, they often did not get a clinical benefit. It \nwas once they got into ketosis that I began to notice the clinical benefit and the powerful \nantidepressant effect. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So probably any nutrition plan, a.k.a diet, \nthat elevated ketones in the urine to the point where you would say, this person is in \nketosis-- or they would say I'm in ketosis-- that was a step in the right direction, \nindependent of exactly what they were eating or not eating to get there, including \nfasting? At that time, probably, fasting wasn't as popular now. Thanks to the incredible \nwork-- I think it's incredible, and he is a former colleague. And I know there's a lot of \ncontroversy about fasting. But I think, for many people, fasting is a powerful tool. For \nothers, it's a less useful tool --of Satchin Panda and others. But fasting certainly will limit \nyour carbohydrate intake and get you into ketosis. Correct? CHRIS PALMER: It will. \nANDREW HUBERMAN: Did you have any patients fast or do intermittent fasting? \nCHRIS PALMER: I did. I had some patients who did what Atkins had called a fat fast, \nwhere they eat primarily fat. So they either fast and/or they eat primarily fats to try to get \ninto a state of ketosis. So for some patients, it was actually quite easy to get into ketosis, \nespecially overweight and obese patients. They have a lot of fat stores on their body and \nactually limiting carbohydrates usually results in high levels of ketosis for them. \nANDREW HUBERMAN: And they probably feel better too, I imagine, because when we \nlimit our starch intake, we start to excrete a lot of water. People can get some pretty \nquick weight loss that even though it may not be fat loss, makes them feel literally a little \nlighter and maybe a little more energetic. Is that right?

Is that schizoaffective? CHRIS \nPALMER: So no. So schizoaffective is the same as schizophrenia essentially. The only \ndifference is it's schizophrenia with superimposed mood episodes. ANDREW \nHUBERMAN: Oh, so it's actually more severe than-- CHRIS PALMER: It can be. \nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. So I have it backwards. CHRIS PALMER: So \nschizoaffective disorder is essentially schizophrenia and plus some mood episodes. \nANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah, maybe I'm thinking of schizotypal? CHRIS PALMER: \nSchizotypal is the low grade, kind of mild paranoia, or kind of eccentric beliefs, and other \nthings. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Folks out there, I have my nomenclature \nbackwards. Schizotypal is the, quote unquote, lower-- \"low level\" schizophrenia or \nschizoid-like. Schizoaffective is as or more severe.

I think about someone with \nschizoaffective disorder, who's suffering from all the sorts of things that you described. \nHow does somebody like that organize themselves in order to stay on a ketogenic diet? \nAnd I say this with all the seriousness in the world. I think there are a lot of people who \ndo not have schizotypal or schizoaffective disorder who have trouble, they claim, \nadhering to a ketogenic diet. It's not the easiest diet. Certainly in its extreme form at first, \nit's not the easiest diet to stick to. So how did he do it? That sounds like a remarkable \nindividual. And I'd also like to just know your general thoughts about adherence to things \nwhen people are back on their heels mentally. How do they get motivated and stick to \nsomething? So the questions were, medication, yes or no? If yes, dosage adjusted, yes \nor no. And if people are suffering from depression or full-blown psychotic episodes, how \ndoes one ensure that they continue to adhere to a diet? CHRIS PALMER: So in terms of \nmedications, he has remained on medication. So early on, I wasn't adjusting anything. I \nwas just in disbelief and shock that this was happening. I didn't know what was going on. \nOver the years, we have slowly but surely tried to taper him off his meds. He has been \non meds for decades. He started medications when he was a young child. His brain is as \ndeveloped in response to all sorts of psychiatric medications. And it has not been easy \nto try to get him off. We continue to try to get him off medication. And it's challenging and \ndifficult. And I just want to say for any listeners, it is-- getting off your meds is very \ndifficult and dangerous. And you need to do it with supervision, with a mental health \nprofessional or a prescriber because it is dangerous. When people reduce their meds \ntoo much, they can get wildly symptomatic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that true for \ndepression as well? CHRIS PALMER: It's true for any psychiatric medication. The brain \nmakes adaptations in response to psychiatric medications. And when you stop them cold \nturkey-- some people are fine. But I wouldn't recommend finding out because I've seen \npatients-- when they stop antidepressants, I've seen patients get flooredly depressed \nand suicidal within three months. I had one patient, almost quit her job because she \nbecame convinced that, well, my life sucks, and it's all because of my boss. And I know \nthat she's just a horrible human being. And she's abusing me. And I was like, whoa, \nwhoa, whoa. I think this is related to your medication change. We got her back on her \nmeds, within three days, she said, oh my god, I can't believe that happened. I almost quit \nmy job. And that would have been the most illogical and irrational decision I've ever \nmade in my entire life. But somehow, it seemed so real just several days ago.

But it \ndoesn't mean that he needs the meds. It means that meds need to be adjusted very \nsafely, and cautiously, and gradually. So that's the medication piece. The adherence \npiece was not easy for him and for other patients. It is very rare that I have a patient who \nI can say, do the ketogenic diet. Come see me in 3 months, and let me know how it was \ngoing. That almost never happens. It has happened, I think, on two occasions. \nANDREW HUBERMAN: But that is, if I understand correctly, what-- perhaps not you-- \nbut many psychiatrists do with medication. It's, here's your prescription. Let's talk in-- \nCHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a month or three months. CHRIS \nPALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's a variable that is probably worth us \nexploring a little bit here as the conversation continues. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. \nANDREW HUBERMAN: That frequent contact and making micro adjustments or macro \nadjustments to medication or nutrition, could be meaningful. CHRIS PALMER: \nAbsolutely. So with this particular patient, early on, he was actually pretty adherent. I \nwas seeing him once a week. And so I could do a lot of education. I was weighing him. I \nwas checking his ketones. I was checking his glucose levels. At that point, I had a blood \nketone monitor in my office. So I knew whether he was compliant or not, which is so \nbeneficial in doing clinical work and research on this diet. It's the only diet where within \nseconds, I can have an objective biomarker of compliance or noncompliance. ANDREW \nHUBERMAN: Such a key point and again, brings to mind, for me, the parallel with \nmedication. A patient can say they're taking their medication, and unless they're in a \nhospital setting, where somebody's checking under their tongue and all of this, they very \nwell could not be taking it or taking more. And you and I both know that blood draws for \nneurotransmitter levels are complicated because you want to know what's in the brain \nand what's functional in the brain. And then we have to imagine that most people there \nprescribed drugs for any number of different psychiatric conditions are not giving blood \nevery time they talk to their psychiatrist or psychologist. No? CHRIS PALMER: No. On \nthat front, when we've looked at studies of compliance, the majority of patients are at \nleast somewhat noncompliant with prescription medications. It's not on purpose. They \nforgot. They take it at night. They were out late. They were off their routine. They forgot \nto brush their teeth-- because that's when they take their meds. And so because it was \nso late, they just crashed when they got home. They forgot to take their meds. Happens \nall the time. If it's a medication that people take more than once a day, the \nnoncompliance rates are much higher because it's just easy to forget.

ANDREW HUBERMAN: \nWhen you say measuring ketones, I want to drill into this a little bit because it does seem \nthat the presence of ketones and somebody being, quote unquote, \"in ketosis,\" it turns \nout to be the key variable. Certainly, in your book, that's one of the major takeaways-- \nalthough there were many important takeaways-- that people get into ketosis. Do they \nhave to stay in ketosis? So for instance, I've followed the-- I don't any longer. But I've \ntried, in the past, the so-called cyclic ketogenic diet, where every third or fourth day, get \nsome pasta, or rice, et cetera. That was interesting as an experiment. But to stay in \nketosis, what sort of blood levels of ketones do you like to see in your patients? What is \nthe range that you think most people could aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: So it really \ndepends on the patient and what I'm treating, quite honestly. And I don't think every \npatient needs the ketogenic diet. For some patients, simply getting rid of junk food can \nmake a huge difference in a mood disorder, for instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So a \njunk food, meaning, highly processed food, food that could last on the shelf a very long \ntime. CHRIS PALMER: Highly processed foods that are usually high in both sugar, \ncarbohydrate, and carbs, and fats. Those seem to be the worst foods. That combination-\n- high sugar, high fat-- seems to be the worst combination for metabolic health. And lo \nand behold, we've got emerging data that suggests, that strongly suggests, it's also bad \nfor mental health. Depression and anxiety are the most common mental disorders. And \nso we have the best data for those disorders. But we actually have a lot of data with \neven bipolar disorder and schizophrenia that insulin resistance, in particular, and insulin \nsignaling in the brain is impaired in people with chronic mental disorders kind of across \nthe board-- all the way from chronic anxiety, depression, to bipolar, to schizophrenia, \nand even Alzheimer's disease. We know that patients with all of those disorders have \nimpaired glucose metabolism and that the insulin signaling system in the brain, which is \ndifferent than insulin signaling in the periphery, seems to somehow possibly be playing a \nrole. So to step back from that, so for some patients, I might just want to decrease \nglucose and insulin levels. And I can do that by getting rid of sweets. For other patients, \nlike patients with schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, especially \nif it's chronic, if I'm using it as a brain treatment, then I do want a ketogenic diet.

But for a lot of the world still, the idea that changing or \nusing nutrition as a dissection tool or as a treatment tool to understand and treat mental \nillness, is still a kind of heretical idea, that to them, it kind of falls in the, OK, well, that's \nlike a woo science or something like that.

And there are many other stories in there as well of truly miraculous \ntransformations.

Chris Palmer is claiming that a \ndietary change can influence schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. That's \nimpossible. And he's a quack. But the thing that immediately got me credibility was I \ndidn't focus on it as a diet. I did a deep dive into the epilepsy literature. So the ketogenic \ndiet, unbeknownst to most people, was actually developed a hundred years ago, 1921, \nby a physician for one and only one purpose-- to treat epilepsy. It wasn't developed as a \nweight loss diet. It wasn't developed as the diet that all human beings should follow. And \nthe reason it was developed is because of this longstanding observation, since the time \nof Hippocrates, that fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting is not a healthy diet. Fasting \nis the process of no diet. So we now understand a tremendous amount of science. Most \npeople think going without food is bad. And they equate it with starvation. But in fact, \nwhen we go without food, it causes tremendous shifts in metabolism-- both brain and \nbody metabolism. And it puts the body into a mode of autophagy, and conservation of \nresources, and all sorts of things that are beneficial to human health. And this is why \nfasting has been used as a therapeutic intervention in almost every culture, in almost \nevery religion for a millennia. But for the most part, that was all thought to be religious \nfolklore. That was just crazy talk. And those stupid people way back then thought God \ncured everything. And so they fasted.

Well, in 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting on a child with seizures and \nfound that, oh, Lo and behold, this religious folklore stuff has something to it. It actually \nworked. The problem with fasting is that you can only fast for so long before you starve \nto death. And that's not a very effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And this child \nwas ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It was just \nfood elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN: \nOK. CHRIS PALMER: So no special diet. But the problem with fasting for epilepsy is that \nas soon as people start eating a normal diet again, their seizures usually come right \nback-- oftentimes, with a vengeance. And so it can be a good short-term intervention. \nThe fasting can take a few days because it can take a few days to get ketosis. And then \nyou can get some relief from chronic seizures. But it's not a good long-term treatment \nbecause, again, people will starve to death. As soon as they start eating, seizures come \nback. So it was actually Dr. Russell Wilder at the Mayo Clinic who developed the \nketogenic diet with one and only one purpose. He wanted to see, can we mimic the \nfasting state, using this special diet, to see if it might stop seizures long-term? And lo \nand behold, it worked. Early results were extraordinarily positive. 50% of patients who \nuse the ketogenic diet became seizure-free. And another 35% had a 50% or greater \nreduction in their seizure frequency, so about 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: \nSorry to interrupt. I didn't mean to do that there. Was it just for pediatric epilepsy or for \nadult epilepsy as well? CHRIS PALMER: So back in the 1920s, we didn't have many \nanti-epilepsy treatments. And a lot of adults were struggling as well. So they were using \nit on anybody who would do the diet. By the 1950s, pharmaceuticals were coming out. \nAnd we had many more anticonvulsant treatments. And there's no question, they work \nfor a lot of people. That's great. And taking a pill is so much easier than doing this diet. \nSo the diet pretty much fell out of favor. And nobody was using it from the 1950s to \nabout the '70s. But lo and behold, even to this day, people with epilepsy, about 30% \ndon't respond to the current treatments that we have available. 30% will have treatment \nresistant epilepsy, which means they continue to have seizures no matter how many \nanticonvulsants they're taking, even if they've had brain surgery. It just doesn't stop their \nseizures. And so in the 1970s, the ketogenic diet was resurrected at Johns Hopkins for \nthese treatment-resistant cases. And lo and behold, it works-- not for all of them, but it \nworks in-- about 1/3 become seizure-free. And these are people who've tried everything \nand nothing's working. So 1/3 become seizure-free.

And so the reality, the godsend for me is \nthat we have decades of neuroscience research on the ketogenic diet and what it is \ndoing to the brain. We know that the ketogenic diet is influencing neurotransmitter levels-\n- in particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. It changes calcium channel regulation and \ncalcium levels, which is really important in the function of cells. It changes gene \nexpression. It reduces brain inflammation. It changes the gut microbiome. Gut \nmicrobiome is a huge topic right now. And there are some researchers who argue that is \nthe primary benefit of the ketogenic diet-- it's changing the gut microbiome in beneficial \nways. So it's doing a lot of things. It obviously improves insulin resistance.  \n \n00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health \n \nIt lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, which improves insulin signaling. The key \nfor my research that I've outlined, the real magic, is that this diet stimulates two \nprocesses that relate to mitochondria. It stimulates a process called mitophagy, which is \ngetting rid of old and defective mitochondria, and replacing them with new ones. And it \nalso stimulates a process called mitochondrial biogenesis, which means that after \npeople have done the ketogenic diet for a while-- months or years-- many of their cells in \ntheir bodies and brains will have more mitochondria. And those mitochondria will be \nhealthier.

The fields of \npsychiatry and neurology hopefully someday will just emerge.

And then maybe we can dive into a couple of these as well as \nget more deeply into these two very interesting aspects of mitochondrial function and \nrepair and turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. In terms of nutritional psychiatry, it's a \nbroad field. And it's in its infancy, is the real answer. If you're looking for randomized \ncontrolled trials documenting efficacy in large numbers of patients with these disorders, \nwe don't have them. They're underway now. But we don't have them yet. What we do \nhave are case studies. We have a lot of mechanistic science papers by some of the \nleading neuroscientists and psychiatrists in the world-- and neurologists in the world kind \nof outlining, this is everything we know that the ketogenic diet is doing. These are the \nproblems in the brains of people with these chronic mental or neurological disorders. So \nwe know that they should work. But the disorders range from chronic depression to-- \nwe've got a trial underway for PTSD. We've got one actually decent pilot trial from the \nNational Institutes of Health for the ketogenic diet for alcohol use disorder, of all things. \nAnd we can go into that a little more. We've got a couple of pilot trials of the ketogenic \ndiet for Alzheimer's disease. And those are randomized controlled trials. We've got case \nstudies of the ketogenic diet for chronic depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. \nThe largest study that we've got in that mental health sphere is a pilot study of 31 \npatients admitted to a French hospital. 28 of those patients were able to do the diet and \nstay on the diet. So 10%, off the bat, noncompliant, couldn't do the diet. So we need to \ninclude that. But of the 28 patients who were able to do-- and these are 28 patients with \ntreatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia. Of \nthe patients who were able to do the ketogenic diet, 100% had at least some \nimprovement in symptoms. 46% had remission of illness. Remission of illness, that does \nnot happen with current treatments. And 64%, I think, were discharged on less medicine \nthan they went into the hospital on. So it wasn't that the people were prescribing more \nmedicine and that's why. They were being discharged on less medication. We've got at \nleast-- again, a lot of the hard core scientists are going to say, show us the randomized \ncontrolled trial with hundreds of patients. And we've got five randomized controlled trials \nunderway now, funded primarily through philanthropy. I can tell you that-- we've talked \nabout that one index patient. But at this point, I have now treated dozens of patients. \nAnd I've heard from hundreds of patients who've been treated by other clinicians, \nresearchers-- or I've just heard from patients from around the world-- who have shared \nstories of complete remission of long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder and", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3046, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1bc6bc60-7065-4793-8d68-817b0771469c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1bc6bc60-7065-4793-8d68-817b0771469c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "99_Dr_Chris_Palmer_Diet_&_Nutrition_for_Mental_Health_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_99.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7782aa32-6ef2-4c3b-a3e1-722daec8d89f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "99_Dr_Chris_Palmer_Diet_&_Nutrition_for_Mental_Health_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_99.pdf"}, "hash": "f4cbdfd85f1507c9b7b41af0474790b99298f17043dd9b9619d68f6738f701a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com \nschizophrenia-- off of psychiatric meds. Some of them-- not all of them, but some of \nthem are able to get off all psychiatric meds and remain in remission. Again, I think I \ndidn't say this before. But it's really important to mention. For people who might be \nunfamiliar with the mental health field and its connection with epilepsy, the reason that \nit's such an important connection is that we use epilepsy treatments in psychiatric \npatients every day in tens of millions of people. So a lot of people don't know this, but I'll \nlist off some names that a lot of your listeners may have heard of. And they probably \nknow them as psychiatric drugs. But in fact, these are epilepsy drugs. Depakote, \nTegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin or gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax-- those \nare all medications that stop seizures. And many of them were developed initially for \nseizures. But we, in the mental health field, quickly steal them and start using them in \ntens of millions of people, even if they're off label. So that means, we don't have \nresearch studies documenting that they're effective. But we go ahead and use them \nanyway because the reality is far too many patients aren't getting better with the FDA-\napproved treatments that we do have to offer. So psychiatrists are just winging it in some \ncases. And we're just throwing whatever we can at them and we absolutely include \nepilepsy treatments. So in many ways, using the ketogenic diet as a treatment for \nserious mental disorders, is nothing new at all. It's an established evidence-based \ntreatment for epilepsy. We use evidence-based treatments for epilepsy across the board \nfor a wide range of mental disorders. And so in many ways, that's all I'm doing with the \nketogenic diet. It just happens to be a diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love \nit. I love it. And I should say, I love it because we had a guest on here early days of the \npodcast. He's a colleague of mine at Stanford. He's a bioengineer, and a psychiatrist, \nphenomenal scientist and psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, who won the Lasker prize, and \nso on and so forth. And he made a really important point, which should have been \nobvious to me but wasn't until he said it, which was the psychiatrist has tools, just like \nthe surgeon has tools. But the tools are language and observing behavior. Those are the \ndissection tools for what's going on in someone's brain. And then as a neuroscientist, I'm \nfamiliar with the neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. And you mentioned that-- and \nthere are these tools of altering brain chemistry, which are of the sorts of drugs you just \nlisted off, or antidepressants, or antipsychotics, that fall into these major bins of adjusting \ndopamine or adjusting serotonin or some combination of dopamine, serotonin \nepinephrine, adenosine, and on, and on, and on.

And so when I hear you say, adjusting nutrition or \nputting people into a ketogenic state or even just eliminating highly processed foods, \nsugars, et cetera, taking care of metabolic syndrome, and then observing tremendous \nrelief in clinical syndromes of-- or symptoms, rather, of psychiatric disorders, it makes \nperfect sense to me. It's yet another dissection tool. And a tool for altering brain \nchemistry. If I think about the landscape, the sort of sociology out there of-- again, there \nseem to be these bins, like a third of people saying, of course, diet, and exercise, and \nsocial connection, and limiting stress, that's the good stuff. That's the stuff that we really \nworks. And then about a third of people are sort of unclear. And then a third of people \nthink, well, if it's not a prescription drug, then it just has no place in medicine. And \nhopefully, that's changing. And certainly, the work that you're doing  \n \n01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health \n \nis going to be important in that transition that I think we will see. I'd like to talk about \nmitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. I think most people learn that the mitochondria \nare the energy factories of cells and that indeed, they are. As a neuroscientist, what I \nknow about them is that they are present everywhere in neurons. Not just in the so-\ncalled cell body, but you can find mitochondria in the furthest little bits of neurons. And \nneurons can be quite big, very large. In fact, meters long or more in some cases and \nsome species, including us. Depending on how tall somebody is, could be many meters-\n- or several meters rather. And that mitochondria do a lot of stuff besides just produce \nenergy, because I think people hear \"mitochondria,\" \"energy,\" and they think, oh, so \nthese patients felt better. They lost weight. They had more energy. And then they're \ndoing better. But here we're talking about remission of auditory hallucinations, people \nfeeling suicidal and then changing their diet and feeling like life is something they can \ndeal with, and maybe even function extremely well, and et cetera. So maybe we could \njust talk about mitochondria for a moment. And then talk about these two major effects. \nWhat are some of the other things that mitochondria are important for in neurons and \nmaybe other cells of the brain? Because as an access point for all this, I think it would be \ngreat if people could learn a little mitochondrial biology.

They take food and oxygen and turn it \ninto ATP. And that's really important. Yeah, we get that. But they're just little batteries. \nThat's all they are. And so one of the reasons that this work is so important it's because \nit combines cutting-edge research in the metabolic field in the aging field. And we can \nstart to pair it with a mental health and neurological health field. So mitochondria-- one \nscientist gave me this analogy. He said, if you think of the cell as a computer, a lot of \npeople think of mitochondria as the power cord to that computer because they're \nproviding the power. And they are, in fact, the power cord to that computer. But actually, \ntheir real function is the motherboard of that computer. So mitochondria are directing in \nallocating resources throughout a cell. That is their primary function. And then they \nhappen to be powerhouses as well. And so to give some clear examples, mitochondria \nplay a direct role in the production, and release, and regulation of some really key \nneurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine. Those are \npretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I would call those-- I \nwould consider those the-- I know you listed more than three. But the sort of primary \ncolors of neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Any one of \nthose in excess or deficiency is going to have profound negative effects on a nervous \nsystem. Or it's going to alter the way that people and animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS \nPALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER: So \nmitochondria are providing both some of the building blocks, if you will, for some of those \nmolecules that are part of the Krebs, citric acid cycle. Some of the intermediate products \nactually go into making those neurotransmitters. Much more importantly, mitochondria \nprovide the energy for the production of those neurotransmitters. And fascinatingly, \nmitochondria are directly related to the release of neurotransmitters. ATP alone is not \nenough. There have been some research studies that have actually found that \nmitochondria move along the membrane of the synapse to release batches of vesicles of \nneurotransmitters, and that if the mitochondria are removed from the synapse and \nresearchers flood that cell with ATP, neurotransmitters usually are not getting released. \nMitochondria are doing other things. We don't entirely even understand what all they're \ndoing or how they're doing it. But they're doing other things than just providing the \npower. Another really important example is that mitochondria are actually the primary \nregulators of epigenetics. If you look at any one factor-- so one study actually found that \nthey're responsible for the expression of about 60% of the genes in a cell. And \nmitochondria do this through a lot of ways that have been known for years and", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2984, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3df2fb51-bdff-4f07-a202-b56fc8844a9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3df2fb51-bdff-4f07-a202-b56fc8844a9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "99_Dr_Chris_Palmer_Diet_&_Nutrition_for_Mental_Health_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_99.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a2881166-12de-49c7-9207-552c1efa09ad", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "99_Dr_Chris_Palmer_Diet_&_Nutrition_for_Mental_Health_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_99.pdf"}, "hash": "a5e54ad1d596acf41d4b69f8be037c9f780759580cfda39ff7868f630f62f5b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com \nsometimes decades. So mitochondria are directly related to the levels of reactive oxygen \nspecies in a cell. They are managing calcium regulation in cells. And we know that those \nthings play a role in epigenetic expression. We know the levels of ATP to ADP or AMP \nalso play a role. And mitochondria are doing those things. But it turns out, mitochondria \nare actually doing much more sophisticated things than even those in terms of gene \nexpression. Mitochondria at least play a role in all of the aspects of the human stress \nresponse. So when humans are stressed, either physically or psychologically, there are \nseveral things that happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline, \ninflammation, and gene expression-- in particular, in the hippocampus-- occur with the \nstress response. And one group of researchers actually genetically modified \nmitochondria in four different ways, and found that all of the stress response, all those \nfour buckets of stress response were impacted in one way or another, implying that \nmitochondria are somehow playing a role in those. In terms of their role in cortisol, we \nknow that mitochondria actually have the enzyme required for the synthesis of steroid \nhormones. So that includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone, some \nnames that maybe everybody's heard of. so that means that if mitochondria are in short \nsupply or dysfunctional, the production of those hormones may become dysregulated. \nMitochondria play a direct role in inflammation. And they turn the inflammatory system \nboth on-- or they at least play a role in turning the inflammatory system both on and off. \nI'm not going to be able to quote the exact study and author. But one paper in cell \nactually identified mitochondria as the key regulator in turning certain inflammatory cells \noff, and that when you inhibit mitochondrial function, those cells don't turn off, that \nmitochondrial levels of reactive oxygen species are a key signaling process to turn the \ninflammatory cell process off. Another study found that macrophages-- so macrophages \nare an important immune cell that play a role in healing. So if you cut yourself, your body \nwill get-- send inflammation that way and send immune cells that way to try to heal your \nskin. And macrophages play an important role in that healing. One group of researchers \ntried to figure out how do macrophages know to switch between the different phases of \nwound healing because the macrophages do different things in the different phases of \nwound healing. And the conclusion of all of their research was that it's mitochondria. \nMitochondria are sending the essential signals that change the state of the macrophages \nto induce these different phases of wound healing.

But you don't know what to do with those data. InsideTracker \nsolves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of \nnutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation-based interventions you might want \nto take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids, \nand other things that impact your immediate and long-term health to bring those \nnumbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you.

But we are doing neither here. What I'm \nhearing is that mitochondria, in addition to being important sources of energy production \nand output in cells-- which, of course, they are-- probably have other roles. Maybe \nsomeday, what we call mitochondria will actually be two or three different little \nsubcellular or organelles. There may be little bits in there that are controlling gene \nexpression and little bits in there that are controlling neurotransmitter production. But at \nleast for now, the name is mitochondria. And thank you, by the way, for illustrating some \nof the other things that they do because in the landscape of science education, \noftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll be a picture or a cartoon of \nmitochondria flexing its muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty \nmitochondria. And then they'll think, oh, they're just sort of like a dumb jock portion of the \ncell. They're not doing anything sophisticated. And everything you listed off is that they \nare doing many sophisticated intricate things within cells. So I think how things are \ncartooned and discussed actually has an impact-- and not just on the general public, but \non the medical field and on the science fields. Anyway, that's more science sociology. \nBut now that everyone is well aware that mitochondria are doing a large number of very \nimportant things in a very regulated way, let's talk about mitophagy. A few years ago, \nbecause a Nobel Prize was given for autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look, \npeople, you can say it either way. People will know hopefully what it means is more \nimportant, which is the gobbling up of one's own cells that are dead or injured. And this \nidea of autophagy, of cells being eaten up within a system-- nervous system or other \nsystem-- has come up again and again. I actually wasn't aware that mitophagy could be \nsuch an important lever. So tell us about mitophagy, which I have to presume is the, \nintentional or not, gobbling up of mitochondria, presumably to replace them with newer \nhealthier mitochondria. Is that right? CHRIS PALMER: It is. So in many ways, mitophagy \nis a subset of autophagy. But it's got its own name because it is specific to mitochondria. \nThere do appear to be some unique regulators of mitophagy compared to autophagy \nmore broadly. Mitochondria actually are playing a role in autophagy itself. And this \nmakes sense because one of-- so the global picture of autophagy is stimulated by \nfasting states or fasting-mimicking states.

But you can really hyperstimulate the \nprocess through fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, other things. And this \nis why fasting and calorie restriction is so kind of such hot topics in the medical field now. \nIt's because they've been shown to induce longevity. And we think it's probably through \nthat process that you're stimulating the body to kind of become lean and conservative in \nterms of its allocation of resources. And the body doesn't just destroy the healthiest \ntissue along with the old dead stuff. It has these processes that identify the old and \ndefective parts first. And they go first. And that's what's beautiful about the whole thing. \nAnd that's why fasting is so important. So mitophagy we know plays a really important \nrole because-- so there's this term called mitochondrial dysfunction, which some \nresearchers are actually wanting to get rid of and move away from because, as you just \nsaid, mitochondria do so many different things. And different mitochondria even within \nthe same cell may very well be specializing in different tasks. And mitochondria from one \ncell to another are sometimes doing very different things, like not all mitochondria can \nproduce cortisol. That's specific to specific cells where those genes are getting turned \non. So it's not like all mitochondria are producing cortisol. Just the ones in your adrenal \ngland, for instance, are producing cortisol. But there is this term \"mitochondrial \ndysfunction.\" And it has long been known, for decades, that mitochondrial dysfunction is \nassociated with everything that ails us essentially. So in the 1950s, we had a theory of \naging that was based on reactive oxygen species. And that's where all the inflammation \nis bad for you comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And where all the noise about \nantioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like in the '90s, it was \nlike, it contains antioxidants. Not to say antioxidants are bad, but they are certainly not \nthe be-all-end-all of health. CHRIS PALMER: They are not. But that's exactly where that \nresearch came from, is that researchers were narrowing in on these reactive oxygen \nspecies are highly, highly correlated with all of the diseases of aging and poor health \noutcomes. It turns out, they're also highly, highly correlated with all chronic mental \ndisorders interestingly. So researchers used the antioxidants to see if, well, maybe if we \ncan stop, somehow tame these reactive oxygen species, we'll improve health outcomes. \nDoesn't seem to work. By the 1970s, our understanding of mitochondria and their role in \nthe production of reactive oxygen species expanded. And that led to the mitochondrial \ntheory of aging. So in the 1970s, we had this mitochondrial theory of aging, based \nprimarily and exclusively on reactive oxygen species.

They're a normal part of human functioning and \ncellular function. So they're not all bad. But we still know high levels of reactive oxygen \nspecies are bad for you. Fast forward to just, I think, maybe last year, with this expanded \nrole of all of the different things mitochondria are doing. So David Sinclair published a \npaper in one of the cell journals, I think, saying that, oh, mitochondria are actually the \nunifying link of everything that we know about aging. Mitochondria are the cause-- or \ndefective mitochondria or defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction, is \npossibly the unifying cause of aging and all of the aging related disorders. So mitophagy \nis trying to address all that. It's trying to say, OK, this is bad. We don't want defective \nmitochondria and how can we get rid of old ones or defective ones and replace them \nwith new ones. And I think the most powerful signal and tool that we have right now is, in \nfact, related to diet.  \n \n01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose \n \nIt's calorie restriction. That is the oldest, truest, kind of best-proven way to prevent aging \nin a wide variety of animal species-- fasting and intermittent fasting. And again, you can \nonly do those things for so long. And then fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate this \nprocess of mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Before we talk about mitochondrial \nbiogenesis, if-- and I certainly accept the idea that mitochondria are extremely important \nin physical health and mental health. That's, for me, is a straightforward conclusion at \nthis point, based on what you've said, whatever and elsewhere, et cetera. And if various \ndiets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can \nassist in mitochondrial function and mitophagy-- and that's at least one of the levers by \nwhich diet can positively impact mental health and physical health, can we conclude that \nthere's something special about low blood glucose in the brain? The sort of common \npathway of all of those things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- for some people, maybe they-- \nmaybe some people have great insulin management, so just removing sweets, refined \nsugars, brings down their blood glucose level substantially. They don't need to go on a \nketogenic diet in order to relieve a low level depression or something like that. Seems \nlike the common theme here is that glucose levels in the brain need to be reduced, \nwhich for me, is surprising because neurons love glucose. There are some really nice \nstudies.

It's sort of if everyone's time someone says, shout, and then someone \nshouts, the neuron is the one responding to the order. And these neurons just, when \nthere's high glucose, they are faithful representatives of what's out there in the world. But \nthen when you fast an animal, they become less faithful representatives of what's out \nthere.

So I think for the typical listener out \nthere, I have to imagine, it's got to be a little confusing. We hear neurons love glucose. \nThey live on glucose. And here, we're saying, let's deprive them of some glucose. Or \nlet's just bring glucose levels down. Or let's switch the fuel source of the brain from \nglucose to ketones. And now the brain really works the way it's supposed to.

The idea that diet can impact mental health and physical \nhealth-- yes, absolutely-- by way of mitochondria-- at least in part, great. But then \nneurons love glucose. So what's going on? Or what do you think is going on? CHRIS \nPALMER: I am not convinced that glucose is the real story. Glucose may, in fact, be a \nsymptom. We know that parts of the brain-- there have been a couple of studies that just \ncame out in the last couple of weeks, I think, documenting that actually astrocytes in the \nhypothalamus play a key role in glucose regulation throughout the body. And it appears \nto be a metabolic role, which in my mind, implies that the mitochondria in those \nastrocytes are probably playing a key role because we know mitochondria play a key \nrole in sensing glucose levels. They play a key role in the release of insulin from the \npancreas. But mitochondria in the brain is also playing a role in kind of balancing how \nmuch glucose is around.

That is the most likely cause of that dysregulation of glucose levels. But we know \nthat if you consume massive amounts of junk food, sugar, and other things, that you can \nget dysregulation of glucose levels. The conundrum, though, is that that's not a universal \nresponse. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And what about the typical person? I've never really \nliked junk food that much. Maybe as a kid, I can recall liking candy. But I was a sandwich \nfor lunch person for a long time.

Do you think-- and here, \nfeel free to speculate. Do you think that those people might feel far better-- or even a \nlittle bit better-- if they were in a lower glucose state?

And everybody's heard people say, sugar is the cause of \neverything that ails you. Or carbs are the cause of everything that ails you. If everybody \ndoes a low carb diet or a ketogenic diet-- and then they go to, so it must be sugar that \nwas the cause. I don't see it as clearly black and white as that. Calorie restriction, \nketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction are inducing metabolic changes in the brain and \nbody. And regardless of what the person was eating, they are inducing metabolic \nchanges that can be really beneficial to brain health. So let me just give a clear black \nand white example of this. And then I can speak to the broader topic that you brought up \nabout just the general population. The easy example of the ketogenic diet being an \neffective intervention for somebody who was not following a bad diet is an infant with \nepilepsy. There are lots of infants who have uncontrollable seizures. They are drinking \nbreast milk. To the best of our knowledge, that is the primary, most beneficial food \nsource an infant could be consuming. Now, some might say, well, maybe the mother is-- \nwhatever, I don't buy that. The mother's breast milk is, in fact, the optimal food source for \nthat infant. And yet that infant is still seizing. If we put that infant on a ketogenic diet, a lot \nof those infants seizures will stop. It doesn't mean that the cause of the infant seizures \nwas a bad diet. But it means that dietary intervention can change brain metabolism and \nimprove symptoms in that person. So going to your broader question about adults, \nmodern-day, the real answer is-- there was just this conference in London, the Royal \nCollege of obesity medicine or something like that. That's not the name. But it's \nsomething along those lines. The conclusion of that conference that invited the greatest \nminds in obesity medicine, the overarching conclusion of that conference was we don't \nknow what causes obesity. It's really important that we sit with that. We don't know what \ncauses obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They don't think excess caloric intake beyond \none's daily metabolic needs is causing obesity?

Well, that's the N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS \nPALMER: Yes. Some will say, it's all the junk food. But we had junk food in the 1970s. \nWhen I was growing up, I grew up on Kool-Aid, and Twinkies, and King Dons, and \nHoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm rewatching the Mad Men series \nnow.

But even in the '50s and, from what I've been reading, \neven in the '30s and '40s, people were not eating grass-fed meat and Brazil nuts with a \nlittle bit of broccoli rabe on the side. That's not the typical intake. So something out there-\n- or maybe multiple things-- are at play to increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER: And at the \nend of the day, I believe-- some will call this speculative. But I actually think we've got a \ntremendous amount of evidence that continues to point in this direction. I believe that \nmitochondria are the key to the obesity epidemic, that there is something in our \nenvironment. So that is either our food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep, \nnot getting adequate sunlight, whatever you want to speculate on, all of the above, all of \nthose things are known to impair mitochondrial function.

Or it means that your metabolism will not \nrise to the challenge of 10 donuts, because some people can eat 10 donuts and go on \nstaying thin and healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I totally agree. Although, I would just \nlike to say that it seems to me that compared to when I was growing up-- and again, I \nhaven't run the statistics-- there are fewer and fewer of those individuals around now. \nJust as when I was growing up, it was one or two kids in class that were quite \noverweight. And then there were some that were mildly overweight. But most were of \nhealthy weight. Nowadays, that's dramatically altered. The landscape is dramatically \naltered in the other direction. It is rare when I encounter one of those can-eat-anything \ntype people. I know one, he's actually an employee at Stanford. He's in our media team \nat Stanford. And this guy, when I take him to lunch, it's like-- he's in his early 70s, and he \ncan eat. And he's incredibly lean. He exercises a little bit. But he's one of these mutants \nthat just can eat, and eat, and eat, and he's lean and he's vital, and he's-- it's wild. And \nhe's an expensive lunch.

My understanding is that-- well, as everyone knows, we inherit \nDNA. We get genes from both of our parents. And they mix. Although there are \nincredible data from Catherine Dulac's lab at Harvard and others showing that we \nactually have entire regions of our brain that carry neurons that are of purely of mom's or \nof dad's DNA, depending on the brain region. This is a wild finding. But it's accurate. And \nthis has actually been known about in terms of heritability of disease, et cetera. Maternal \nDNA, DNA from mom, genes from our mother-- not to place blame on mothers at all. My \nunderstanding is that the mitochondrial DNA come exclusively through the maternal \nside. Is that true? CHRIS PALMER: So it's a great question. And I've been asked this \nbefore. And yeah, psychiatrists are known for blaming mothers. And some might say that \nI'm trying to redo that whole thing and blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: \nThe data are the data. I'm not trying to blame mothers here. Mothers play an essential \nrole in everything. But if it is true that mitochondria are the linchpin of all this and \nmaternal DNA is what determines the mitochondrial DNA, I think it's an important place \nto look. CHRIS PALMER: It's an important question. And the answer is unequivocally no. \nThat's not the way it works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, then vindication for anyone \nthat was asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: And so let me explain it. So mitochondria have \n36 genes unto themselves. 13 of those genes code for some of the mitochondrial \nmachinery of making ATP. And the other 36 play roles in epigenetic regulation, play \nroles in whole body metabolism, and other things. So that is what you're inheriting from \nyour mom. It's the mitochondria and those 36 genes for the most part. But the majority of \nproteins that make up mitochondria, over, I think, 1,300 genes that make up \nmitochondria are actually encoded in the nuclear DNA. And so you inherit a copy from \nboth your mother and your father. So the majority of people who have mitochondrial \ndefects or rare mitochondrial diseases actually could inherit them from either mom or \ndad because it can be a defect in the nuclear genes that code for proteins that make up \nmitochondria. The much bigger issue when-- so when I talk about mitochondrial \ndysfunction being a primary driver of mental illness, metabolic illness, it's not that people \ninherit a defective mitochondrion or mitochondria from mom, and then that just ruins their \nlife forever. That's actually not the way it works. The beautiful thing about this theory is \nthat it connects all of the risk factors that we already know play a role in mental health \nbut also metabolic health.

ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC \ndirectly or the smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. Those studies have been done. \nSo mitochondria actually have CB1 receptors right on them. And various researchers, a \ncouple of studies from Nature actually documented this, that the mitochondrial CB1 \nreceptors are primary-- kind of primary points of the influence of marijuana on human \nbehaviors and effects. Because when they remove CB1 receptors in animal models, \nthese changes don't happen. So the CB1 receptors-- we've got some large studies of \nadolescents who use a lot of marijuana. And the areas where the mitochondria have the \ngreatest number of CB1 receptors are areas of their brains that actually are atrophied or \nshrunk compared to normal healthy controls. So that means their brain tissue is aging \nprematurely. It's shrinking prematurely. But the CB1 receptors on mitochondria also \nseem to play a role in the memory impairment that can be induced from THC. And they \nalso play a role in the kind of lack of motivation, the behavioral amotivational state from \nTHC. Now, again, for people who want to chillax, that's what they're looking for. They \ndon't want to remember anything. They don't want to think. They want to be spaced out. \nThey want to relax. That's great. But it's important that they know that they're actually \nharming the mitochondria in their brain cells. And that although there's always an \nopportunity to repair mitochondria and always an opportunity to stimulate mitochondrial \nbiogenesis, so you can get it back, but if you keep doing it chronically, you're probably \nnot helping your overall mental or metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I'm \nglad you brought up THC. We did an episode on cannabis. We also did one on alcohol-- \nprobably lost some friends from that one. When you look at the data, it's very clear. I'm \nnot arguing that people dislike the effects of these compounds when they take them. But \nit is clear that, at least to me, based on the data that regardless of what people have \nread about red wine, that not drinking any alcohol is going to be healthier than drinking \nalcohol, and that the thresholds for alcohol ingestion before people start to negatively \nimpact their health is about one or two per week.

So drinking alcohol \nmakes alcohol more rewarding to the brains of alcohol drinkers, but that it also might \nalter glucose metabolism, that basically alcohol is not good for our brains. Do I have that \ncorrect? CHRIS PALMER: You do have that correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. What \nhappens if you take an alcoholic or somebody that just drinks two to four nights a week a \ncouple of drinks, which I think is pretty common out there, and you put them on a \nketogenic diet? Has that experiment been done? CHRIS PALMER: That experiment has \nbeen done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: It led by none other than a \nwoman named Nora Volkow, who is one of the leading neuroscientists and addiction \nresearchers in the world. She is the director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse. \nShe's been hot on the trail of metabolic abnormalities in the brains of people with alcohol \nuse disorder, which I will just refer to as alcoholics because that's what everybody knows \nit as. So she's been hot on this trail for many, many years. And as you said, it turns out \nthat the reward pathways, in particular, are metabolically compromised in alcoholics. \nAnd the metabolic compromise essentially, in a nutshell, means they aren't getting \nenough fuel from glucose. The interesting thing is that when people drink alcohol, your \nliver converts alcohol into a molecule called acetate. That acetate travels up to the brain \nand fuels brain cells, in particular, some of these reward pathway cells more than others. \nAnd so chronic alcoholics have this chronic deprivation of energy in these cells. And so \nNora Volkow and other researchers at the National Institutes of Health did a study in \nwhich they set out to see if we can change this brain metabolic problem in alcoholics. \nWill that affect clinical symptoms of alcoholism? And will it do anything? It's clinically \nuseful. And so they actually did a pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics to \na detox unit. Half of the patients got a ketogenic diet. The other half got the standard \nAmerican diet. And then everybody else, all of them got the same detox protocol. The \npatients who got the ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines for their detox. \nDespite that, they had fewer withdrawal symptoms from the alcohol. They reported fewer \ncravings for alcohol. And the researchers did brain scans, which showed improved brain \nmetabolism in these key areas that they were looking at. And their brains showed \nreduced levels of neuroinflammation, which was also something they were really \ninterested in. And so that one study says to us that even though most people would think \nalcoholism has nothing to do with diet, alcohol is just drinking too much.

But this \nis one of the leading neuroscientists in the world who's hot on this trail. This is what she \nbelieves. And this is what I believe. It's that if we can correct the brain metabolic defects \nfrom chronic alcohol use, we might be able to help people be sober and give them a \nfighting chance. Or give them an edge up or pull a lever that we can use in their favor, \nfor their benefit. There's one caution to all of this research that I really do want to \nhighlight. And so now, I'm going to get hate mail from all the keto community. ANDREW \nHUBERMAN: That's OK. I admire you for talking about nutrition at all because anytime \none talks about nutrition, you're going to get hate mail from somebody. CHRIS PALMER: \nSo the caveat to all of this is that as part of the research that those researchers were \ndoing, they actually wanted to see what will happen to alcohol levels if an animal \nconsumes alcohol while on a ketogenic diet. So they didn't do this in humans yet. This is \na fairly easy study to do. So I'm hoping somebody will do this study soon. But they \ninstead put rats half of them on a standard diet and half of them on a ketogenic diet. And \nthen they exposed them to the exact same amount of alcohol. The rats who were on the \nketogenic diet had a five-fold increase in blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase. \nANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, they drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No. \nANDREW HUBERMAN: --it was metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER: It was \nmetabolized differently. The rats all got the same amount of alcohol. ANDREW \nHUBERMAN: So for people out there who are ketogenic, I'm chuckling, but who are not \nalcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please do something about it because it's so detrimental. \nBut I guess does this mean that they can drink less in order to get the effect of alcohol \nthat most people are seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date is what you \ncall that. You only need a half a drink instead of three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I \nwould think the keto community would thank you for this unless they somehow have a \nstake in the alcohol industry.

ANDREW \nHUBERMAN: It could be deadly. CHRIS PALMER: It could be deadly, and/or it could be \nreally-- yeah, deadly to you or someone else because unfortunately, a lot of times when \npeople drink, they get behind the wheel.

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now, it's a \nvery important point. And thank you for raising that. I hear this again about mitochondria, \nabout blood glucose, you mentioned astrocytes. And for those of you-- that earlier \nastrocytes are a non-neuron cell type in the brain, a glial cell type that my postdoc \nadvisor was known for popularizing the modern science of glia, which include astrocytes. \nAnd I'd be remiss if I didn't say that they are considered the cells that hold everything \ntogether in the brain and are kind of passive observers.

And I guess that raises the question of, \nwhen one goes on a ketogenic or low blood glucose diet or fast, has anyone observed \nchanges in the brain? Has anyone had neuroimaging of humans and their brains under \nconditions of ingesting one diet or another, whether or not they're psychiatric-- suffering \nfrom a psychiatric disorder or not? I would think that's where the gold is. CHRIS \nPALMER: We do have some of those studies. When you do a neuroimaging study, you \ncan measure a lot of different things. So one thing with a PET scan, you can measure \nglucose metabolism. So a researcher, Stephen Cunnane is doing that research in \nparticular in Alzheimer's disease patients and Alzheimer's disease models but in \nhumans. And that's because we know that-- again, a common finding in patients with \nAlzheimer's disease is this glucose hypometabolism, some people are attributing it to \ninsulin signaling impairment. And so some people are calling it type III diabetes. At the \nend of the day, I think the clearest signal that we have is that cells aren't getting enough \nenergy from glucose as a fuel source. That is something that I think I can confidently say \nthat's backed by numerous research studies. There's debate in the research field about \nwhether that's a primary driver of the illness. I happen to believe it is. And if you ask the \nquestion, well, why would cells not be getting enough fuel from glucose? You have to \nfocus on mitochondria because they're the ones producing the fuel from that glucose. So \nyou somehow you have to implicate mitochondria in that process one way or another. \nOthers will say, no, that's just a side effect of whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease. \nSo Stephen Cunnane has done studies where he even gives ketone supplements. \nANDREW HUBERMAN: These are liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone \nesters or ketone salts. And it has actually found that these brain metabolism deficits can \nbe corrected, at least short-term, by giving a ketone supplement. ANDREW \nHUBERMAN: Is this in the context of people also ingesting some carbohydrate? \nBecause I confess, I've tried the ketogenic diet. I probably did it wrong. This was years \nago. And then the cyclic ketogenic diet. But in the last year or so, I've started using liquid \nketone esters. And I do eat some carbohydrates each day, usually in proportion to how \nmuch high intensity exercise I'm doing. Those liquid ketone esters, for me-- at least \nsubjectively-- I feel greatly increase my energy levels and my ability to focus mentally. \nAnd they improve my sleep. This is my observation tracking some data but just, again, \nsubjectively. So in this example, are you talking about people taking ketone esters or \nketone salts on a backdrop of a ketogenic diet or on the backdrop of a more typical diet? \nCHRIS PALMER: So he's done both.

Those kids would love to be off \nthe ketogenic diet. Their parents would love to have them off the ketogenic diet. \nANDREW HUBERMAN: They had no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER: \nThere is not one case report of any child controlling his or her seizures using exogenous \nketones without also doing the ketogenic diet. I just find it hard to believe that at least \nsome of those people haven't tried it out to see. I do know some patients with bipolar \ndisorder and even schizophrenia who are doing extraordinarily well on a ketogenic diet. \nThey have tried to switch off the ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones. Their \nsymptoms came back. And so they found that it just wasn't effective. Now, again, those \nare anecdotes. My scientific speculation about why is because the ketogenic diet is \nactually not necessarily about ketones themselves. Ketones are one of a multifaceted \nstory there. And so when people do a ketogenic diet, they're also improving-- they're \nlowering glucose levels. They're improving insulin signaling. They're ramping up \nmitochondrial biogenesis, in particular, in the liver because mitochondria actually make \nketones. That's where they're made. And they're primarily made in the liver \nmitochondria. So when somebody is on in a fasting state or on a ketogenic diet, their \nliver mitochondria go through the roof because they're being called to action. It's like, \nhey, body's in starvation mode. Get to work. And so the mitochondria-- the cell senses \nwe need more mitochondria to process fat to turn it into ketones so that those ketones \ncan get up to the brain and keep the brain fueled, because fatty acids can't fuel the \nbrain. Only ketones can. Now, so my sense is that-- and the gut microbiome changes \nand everything, the changes in hormones-- so if you're eating a lot of donuts and \ndrinking a bottle of ketones, the donuts are going to prevent your body from lowering \nglucose levels. You're still going to have the high glucose levels from the donuts. You're \nstill going to probably have the impaired insulin signaling. You're probably still going to \npossibly have some inflammation from the inflammatory effects of that food. And so just \ndrinking ketones alone won't be enough. I think for people who are metabolically healthy, \nI'll include you in that, I think ketones can play a really beneficial role, no doubt.

And that every time they have a severe craving for alcohol, they \ndrink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which sort of tastes like alcohol. The \nketone esters, when I take them, I drink them straight. Sometimes I'll put them in seltzer. \nAnd I'm not a big drinker, as I mentioned. I might have an alcoholic drink every once in a \nwhile. I just don't ever crave it. I just do it every maybe-- I think 2020 was the last time I \nhad a drink of alcohol. So obviously, I'm not a good representative example. But the \nketones taste good to me.  \n \n02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose  \n \nAnd they obviously don't get you drunk. They do seem to flick on my alertness pretty \nquickly. My understanding is that they are the brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning, \nthey are going to be the first fuels used by the brain when there's a buffet of fuels \navailable. If there's glucose in my bloodstream, there's circulating liquid ketones, the \nketones would be used first or preferentially. Is that true? CHRIS PALMER: I think it's a \ncomplex question. Some research that we have suggest that there are brain areas or \nbrain cells that require glucose and cannot use ketones. So 100% of the brain cannot be \nfueled with ketones as far as we can tell. So there are some areas that require glucose. \nAnd that's probably the reason we have gluconeogenesis to keep the body going and \nkeep the brain going no matter what. But when ketones are available, especially if \nketones are high, the way I think about it is not that ketones are the preferred fuel source \nand glucose goes to the wayside. But the way I think about it is that you have a range of \ncells with varying degrees of metabolic health. And some of those cells are going to be \nextraordinarily healthy with appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. And those cells \nare probably going to continue to use glucose as a fuel source. But if ketones happen to \nbe there, sure, they'll use that, too. Why not? But the real money is metabolically \ncompromised tissues, whether it's brain cells or other tissues that-- we're talking about \nthe brain. So if you've got metabolically compromised brain cells-- because it's not \nacross the board. Like with Alzheimer's brain scans, there are specific regions that are \nmore metabolically compromised than others. And that's why we see patterns of atrophy \nin specific brain regions. It's because those regions are dysfunctional metabolically for \nwhatever reason. And we can get into why that might be. But my sense is that if you've \ngot a metabolically compromised cell, that cell is sending out a distress signal. That cell \nis calling resources from the body, like feed me. Give me something.

Thank you for that clarification. I'd like to \ntalk about Alzheimer's and age-related cognitive decline generally. I know many people \nout there are just terrified of losing their memory for the obvious reasons. Memory sets \ncontext, et cetera. And many people have relatives that suffer from Alzheimer's or other \nforms of dementia. I've heard that the ketogenic diet and diets like it can be very \neffective for helping to offset some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's and age-related \ncognitive decline. In fact, I even have a friend I won't out by institution, who's the chair of \nCardiology, who contacted me, of all people, asking whether or not I was aware of any \nstudies or whether or not I knew of anybody who had benefited from ketogenic diet for \nAlzheimer's. And I thought, well, why don't you ask one of your colleagues in neurology? \nBut his response was really interesting. He said there are many books out there for the \ngeneral public. There are a lot of online discussions about this. There are a lot of \nassertions about this, and some animal studies. Again, these are his words. There are \nvery few, if any, controlled clinical trials exploring the role of the ketogenic diet for the \ntreatment or reversal of Alzheimer's and age-related cognitive decline. I'm hoping that \nstatement was incorrect or soon will be incorrect-- because those trials are ongoing-- but \nhe said, yeah, the people are most popular for telling us about the important role and \npositive role of being in ketosis for Alzheimer's, for some reason, they just won't do a \nclinical trial. And that's been frustrating to the community. So this is a very educated, \nvery accomplished person who's a physician of heart medicine as opposed to something \nelse related to the brain.

But goodness, I would think this would be the obvious thing for \nNIH. I'm on study section but not for these sorts of experiments. Why isn't money just \navalanching into this area based on all the anecdotal evidence that people are talking \nabout? CHRIS PALMER: So we've got a couple of small pilot clinical trials. The best one \nwas a randomized controlled trial. I think it only included 26 subjects, something like that, \nrandomized to 12 weeks of a low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks of ketogenic diet. \nSome of the participants got keto first and then low fat. Other participants got low fat \nthen keto. And that trial actually found that when patients were in ketosis, they had \nstatistically significant improvement in activities of daily living and quality of life. And they \ndid have improvement in cognitive function. But it didn't reach statistical significance, that \nimprovement did not. We've got other trials. We've got several animal models showing \nthat the ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in Alzheimer's \nmodels. So it can reduce plaques and tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment in \nanimal models. And we've got a couple of other small pilot trials of ketogenic diet in \nhumans, showing that it improves biomarkers compared to, say, the low fat diet or the \nAmerican Heart Association diet. So we've got those. I think one of the biggest \nchallenges that I'll just share openly-- and this is-- I'm somebody who's pretty passionate \nabout this research. And I believe it has a lot of potential. But Johns Hopkins' \nresearchers attempted to do exactly this kind of a study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic \ndiet versus the, I think, American Academy of Aging-- or something like that-- diet, is the \ncontrolled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which presumably has starches in there. CHRIS \nPALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think that's the key variable. CHRIS PALMER: \nProbably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: And some potatoes-- CHRIS \nPALMER: Whole grains, lots of whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, some \npotatoes. CHRIS PALMER: And they spent, I believe, over three years. They screened \nover 1,300 people who expressed interest. At the end of the day, I think they only got 27 \npeople to enroll. And only 14 of those people completed the study. ANDREW \nHUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, what they found was that the \nsubjects who achieved ketosis had cognitive improvement. But people on study section \nare going to look at a study like that and say, even if the science is there, if you can't get \npeople to do this diet, why would we spend money on researchers trying to get people to \ndo this diet?

The rest generally don't end up \nhappening. That is very informative. What you just described is very informative because \nnow it makes sense to me. There's no conspiracy. It's not big pharma, I don't think, is \ntrying to suppress trials of ketogenic diets on Alzheimer's because I would imagine the \nfirst thing that pharma would want to do is to see that study done. So they didn't have to. \nAnd then the moment it was done, if it showed a positive effect, they'd probably want to \nisolate the molecule and wrap it up in something that people would take, right? CHRIS \nPALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I don't think there's any active suppression \nby pharma. I think pharma would probably be cheering from the sidelines because they \ncould capitalize on it, because ultimately, the studies are done by scientists. But the \ntreatments are generally doled out by pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians. So I \ndon't believe there's a conspiracy there. That is very interesting. And it's kind of amazing, \ngiven our discussion of earlier, which is that you had a patient that was having \nschizophrenic symptoms who managed to stay on this diet. So is there something \nspecial about Alzheimer's patients and people with age-related cognitive decline? \nPresumably, they're very dependent on others to cook for them and shop for them. I \nthink that this is almost perfect controlled environment for getting this study done. CHRIS \nPALMER: I think that is the key issue. So again, I got patients-- I get patients with bipolar \ndisorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people to do this diet and stay with it. \nBut it's because I'm providing a weekly session for them. And I imagine this study did not \nprovide that kind of intensive support. In the pilot trial that I described to you, they \nactually got, I think, over 90% compliance with the different dietary interventions. So \nsome of it is going to be dependent on the research group. And does the research group \nunderstand that this is not-- it's not like prescribing a pill. Here, take this pill. And take it \nevery day and come back in three weeks. And even then, we don't know for sure that the \npatient took the pill every day. We just assume they took the pill every day. And studies \nsay they probably didn't. So I think when we think about a dietary intervention, we need \nto think about more intensive support and education. And that support could be a health \nand wellness coach. It could be a dietician. It could be education of the family. It might \neven be providing them with dietary meals. That maybe for six months, we actually \nprovide them with ketogenic meals-- once a week, put them in your freezer. Microwave \nthem when needed-- to make this diet as easy and doable as possible.

More importantly-- I didn't mention this before. But \nthe number one reason I am so successful at getting patients to stay on this diet for \nyears, is because of the consequences to them when they go off of it. That is the reason \nI can get schizophrenic patients and bipolar patients to do this diet, whereas other \npeople can't get an everyday human being to do it for weight loss because the weight \nloss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms when they break the \ndiet. Oftentimes, they are rewarded. They eat something they really enjoy. And they get \na little bit of a dopamine rush from it. And they're off to the races. They're like, I'm going \nto-- oh, I've already cheated. I'll cheat again. I'll get back on it someday. And they never \nget around to it. My patients, when they go off the diet, they start hallucinating within 48-- \nor 24, 48 hours. And they quickly realize that was a really stupid thing to do. That piece \nof cake was not at all worth the torment that I'm experiencing now. So they get back on \nthe diet. I suspect with Alzheimer's disease, we might notice something similar. Some of \nthese people have very mild symptoms. So maybe they won't have that kind of a \nreinforcement, negative reinforcing kind of experience. But I think some of them will. \nSome of them recognize that they are impaired cognitively. And if this diet could help \nthem remember better, if this diet could help them function better-- and again, that's what \nthe pilot trial showed, is activities of daily living. That means these people are able to go \nto the bathroom on their own. They're able to get themselves dressed. Whereas, they \nneeded help with those things before. Those are actually really important things to both \nthe patient and the caregiver. And if they go off the diet and then quickly revert into a \nmore symptomatic state, that might be reinforcing enough for them to figure out a way to \ndo the diet on their own. And if we think about, if this really is an effective intervention-- \nand yes, we need longer trials, larger trials, all of that, because there are plenty of \nstories in the medical field where pilot trials looked really spectacular and promising. And \nthen larger trials just failed to show the benefits. I believe, based on all the science of \nmetabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, all of that, I believe the science \nmakes this an obvious treatment that has real potential. So people will call me biased. \nThat's fine. I've got my bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based on clinical observation \nand extensive clinical observation at that-- I think biases that are simply because we \nwant to feel a certain way or believe something are worth critiquing. But bias based on \nobservation-- here, I should mention that most of what we know about human memory \nwas sparked by one patient, a famous HM, who I think was living in Harvard Medical, in \none of the hospitals around.

So this \nidea that everything has to be a randomized clinical trial, to me, is crazy. Of course, \nthat's a gold standard. And it's essential. But there's so much information in textbooks, \nmedical textbooks in particular, that are gleaned from single-patient case studies or from \nthree-patient neurostimulation in the brain or something of that sort.

Clearly, what \nyou're doing, the important work  \n \n02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss \n \nthat you're doing clinically, and in the research side, and in public communication, is \nassisting this. I have a question about-- or more of a statement/question about the \nketogenic diet. Based on everything that we've talked about, seems to me that the \nketogenic diet for weight loss is a very interesting aspect of the diet as is intermittent \nfasting for weight loss even though it might just be by way of caloric restriction that \noccurs with fasting. But then in some ways, the effects of the ketogenic diet on weight \nloss are a bit of a decoy for most people. That's where their mind goes. This person lost \nX amount of weight. Maybe that made them feel better. Maybe that actually made them \nunderweight. I think you've talked about it. For some people, it can actually bring them \nunder weight. I'm glad that we got the chance to dive into the description of ketogenic \ndiet for epilepsy because it really is a medical intervention that has a side effect of \nweight loss or could be used to treat obesity and induce weight loss. But it's really about \nfar more than that. And that raises a question for me, which is-- we've been talking about \nthe ketogenic diet as one thing. But I've heard you discuss this before, where just as a \nphysician will prescribe different dosage ranges of a given drug, you can prescribe \ndifferent dosage ranges of a nutritional plan, a diet. It's not one thing. It's not necessarily \nzero carbohydrates or 100 grams or 50 grams. It depends on the patient and a lot of \nother factors. I've heard you list off various things classic keto. Maybe you could just \nbriefly tell us what that typically is, because I think most people think it means eating a \nlot of meat and not carbohydrates. But it might not be that. Fasting and then some of the \nother-- you mentioned Atkins earlier.

But for somebody who, let's say, is depressed-- they've had some rounds of \ndepression. Maybe they're on antidepressants, maybe not-- and they want to try \nsomething like this. Obviously, this has to be done in concert with a physician observing \nall this. But what is the typical thing that you probe with first? Just like with a drug, you \nmight probe with 20 milligrams of a drug. What's your typical initial dietary intervention \nprobe? Terrible languaging, I realize. And I'm criticizing myself for that. But I think people \nget the idea. CHRIS PALMER: The real answer is that I don't have a one-size-fits-all \nrecommendation for any person. So the first thing that I'm going to assess with the \npatient is, what symptoms are they having? What is their current diet like? And what are \nthey willing to do? I try to meet them where they're at. So if somebody-- and I want to \npoint out. You mentioned the all-meat version of this diet, which is often referred to as \nthe carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Very controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER: \nThere is no doubt that exists. Some people swear by it. They swear they've tried other \nversions of ketogenic diets and only when they went to a carnivore diet did they get \nbenefits. But there are vegetarian and vegan versions of the ketogenic diet. So in my \nmind, this is not at all about the diet wars of animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods. \nIt's about inducing a state of ketosis, which is mimicking the fasting state. That is what \nit's about. And you can do that by not eating anything, by fasting and/or intermittent \nfasting. And you get your results. So no diet is a ketogenic diet. So it's not about the \nfoods or the types of foods that you're eating. It's about inducing a state of ketosis. The \nfirst variable I'm going to look at when I recommend this or prescribe this is the person's \ncurrent weight. If somebody is obese versus somebody who's thin, I'm going to use \ndifferent dietary strategies for those two situations. In the obese patient, they have tons \nof fat stores on their body already. Usually, it is a goal of theirs to tap into some of those. \nAnd they'd like to lose some weight if they're going to try a ketogenic diet for brain health \nanyway. And so I'm going to use that. So that person, really, the diet is carbohydrate \nrestriction. And that usually is a sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Both \nsimple carbohydrates, meaning sugars and fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose, \ndefinitely. So no added sugars, essentially. You can have added natural sweeteners like \nstevia or monk fruit. You might use artificial sweeteners. Years of doing this, I'd probably \nrecommend steer away from them if you can because I think they tend to stimulate \ncravings for high carb foods. So if you can kind of get through a couple of weeks without \nsweet things, your cravings for those will go down. And it'll make the diet easier and a \nlittle more sustainable.

So I'm going to say less than 20 grams of carbs a day for those people. \nThey can have all the protein they want. They can have vegetables. And they can have \nall the fat they want. But I'm not going to push fat on those people. I'm not going to tell \nthem, eat a lot of fat, at the same time because I want to use the fat on their body as the \nfat source, at least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are you encouraging healthy fats \nlike monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? Are you encouraging people to eat a little less \nbutter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: I tend to encourage, again, a wide range of fats. And \nit's going to depend on the person. A lot of times, people come to me with very specific \nideas. But I'm going to tend to encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, which are usually \nconsidered, even by the American Heart Association, healthy sources of fat. The more \ncontroversial thing are things like coconut oil or coconut cream, which the American \nHeart Association might say is not a healthy fat, I kind of disagree with that and don't \nthink it's unhealthy at all actually. And when you look at the epidemiological studies of \nsaturated fat causing heart disease or causing adverse outcomes, at best, maybe \nincreases your risk 10% to 15%-- at best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: How much coconut \noil can people ingest, anyway, before they either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- or just sort \nof get tired of coconut oil? Anyway, your point is taken. But they can eat meat if they like \nmeat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or they can eat eggs. Or if \nthey don't like meat and eggs, they could eat sardines or things of that sort. I personally \ncan't-- I can't even stomach the-- I don't even like the word \"sardine.\" I have nothing \nagainst the actual fish. But that's just me. But obviously, people have-- I say this \nbecause people have different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW \nHUBERMAN: I'll eat a steak. But I'm not going to eat a sardine. CHRIS PALMER: And \nI'm going to go with that. And again, there are vegan sources of protein that-- people can \neat tempeh and other things. So that's the obese person. It's carb restriction as the \nprimary initial phase. The thin person is going to need to eat a lot of fat because they \ndon't have a lot of fat stores on their body. And if I want them in ketosis, clinical ketosis, \nI'm going to have to feed them fat. So that's the person that I'm going to say, make sure \nyou get in avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. So heavy cream is delicious. \nIt's a delicious way to get your fats in. I have one patient who just drinks it straight, to just \ntry to get it in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I get it. I've never had an appetite for sweets. I \nabsolutely love savory fatty food. When I was in high school, I was thin. So I was able to \ndo this. But I used to drink half-and-half. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night \nand drink it just because it tastes so, so good.

Within three weeks, said, I don't need prescription medicine. I can't believe how \nmuch better I feel. And all I did was cut out some of the high carb foods in my diet.

ANDREW \nHUBERMAN: A couple of questions, a little more detailed, but I think a lot of people will \nhave this on their mind. Is it ever the case that you'll prescribe somebody the ketogenic \ndiet in conjunction with intermittent fasting? So eat keto but eat between the hours of, \nwhatever, 11:00 AM and 8:00 PM or something like that. That's the first question. CHRIS \nPALMER: Absolutely. And I have one patient with type 2 diabetes and chronic \ndepression. And he will try to follow the ketogenic diet. And sometimes, his blood sugars \nare still very high. And sometimes I will ask him to do either intermittent fasting or even a \nthree or four day water fast. And it is shocking. When he does a three or four day water \nfast, the first day or two, he feels like crap. I'll just say up front, don't do it if you've got an \nimportant meeting or business trip or anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: So \nthis is just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: This is just consuming water. ANDREW \nHUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: I usually tell him he can have plain \nblack coffee or tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: You have mercy after all. CHRIS \nPALMER: I have a tiny ounce of mercy. But when he does it, his blood sugars plummet \nin a good way, his blood sugars are normalizing. But the last time he did it, he actually \ngot to seven days at one point. And he said, I feel great. I want to keep going. I can't \nbelieve that I'm not hungry. But I am not hungry at all. I don't miss food at all. And at \nseven days, I kind of cut the cord. I was like, no, no. We're done. ANDREW \nHUBERMAN: He needs to eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] We're done. ANDREW \nHUBERMAN: You got to eat. Well, I find it really interesting that the intermittent fasting, \nof course, controversial at some level, but as to whether or not it's just beneficial by way \nof caloric restriction-- because it is one way to achieve caloric restriction-- whether or not \nhas additional benefits. But I'm very interested in the neural side of it. And it does seem \nthat the fasted state can start to take on its own rewarding properties, where people get \ndopamine release not from eating, as most everyone does, but from abstaining from \nfood.

But for non-anoxerics, I think it's \ninteresting to note that eventually not eating can have its own rewarding properties to it \nthat aren't just related to weight loss. But in the short-term, feeling-- in other words, \nfeeling really good by way of abstaining from eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. And that's \nactually-- it raises an important risk that I haven't mentioned yet. But at least in \npsychiatric patients-- but even in some patients who just use the keto diet for weight \nloss, I have seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So these are people that \naren't sleeping very much. Are they also getting kind of delusional, thinking they're going \nto run for president? CHRIS PALMER: No. So the distinction between hypomania and \nmania-- so mania, you might become psychotic and delusional. Mania, by definition, is \nproblematic. It's causing a problem in some way or another. And if you have psychotic \nsymptoms, it's definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, for better or worse, \nis something every human being probably craves. So it is feeling extraordinarily good. \nIt's getting by on less sleep. But you don't need to sleep. Who needs sleep? I've got \nthings to do. My brain is running on all cylinders. I feel so creative. There have been lots \nof famous people through the ages who have been bipolar, probably bipolar. And some \nof their most productive periods of time, whether it's art or creating scientific models or \nwhat-have-you, were probably during hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So \nwhat do you do in that case? I'm obsessed with getting sufficient quality sleep. It's a kind \nof a repeating theme in our podcast and many of my social media posts. And I always \nrecommend behavioral tools first, then exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera, at \nappropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, and occasionally, \nfor people who are doing all that and still struggle with sleep, supplementation. One of \nthe things that I've seen some data on is that for people who are following a low \ncarbohydrate diet, that inositol, in particular, can be helpful for getting into sleep probably \nbecause it's a bit of an-- has a bit of an anti-anxiety effect. But presumably, there are \nother things out there, too. The magnesiums will generally do that. A hot bath will do \nthat, too, for that matter. But what you're talking about is people who are going, what, a \nday and a half without sleep? Or they're just two hours of sleep a night? CHRIS \nPALMER: So the worst case I saw was actually a mental health professional who didn't \nrecognize it initially. He went six months with two to four hours of sleep every night. \nANDREW HUBERMAN: Because they were on a ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER: He \nwas on a ketogenic diet, was getting by on two to four hours of sleep every night, did not \ninitially recognize that this was a problem. He was feeling great.

I'm losing too much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, I didn't \nmean to interrupt. I was just thinking there are some social media personalities \nassociated with nutrition that might be hypomanic. I'll let you do the clinical evaluation. \nSo what does somebody do in that case? So I don't know that I've ever been hypomanic. \nBut as I mentioned earlier, unless I've done a very high intensity workout early in the day \nand I need to replenish carbohydrates, I typically eat meat, fruit, and vegetables \nthroughout the day-- minimum amounts of fruit but some. And then at night, I switch over \nto mainly carbohydrate. It really helps me sleep. It replenishes glycogen stores. I sleep \nreally well, wake up the next morning, repeat. And of course, this goes against a lot of \nthe dogma that, oh, you're not supposed to eat carbohydrates late in the day and \n[MUMBLES]. This is what works for me. And so I do it. For somebody like this mental \nhealth professional, who is hypomanic, would going off the ketogenic diet entirely be the \nbest idea? Or could it be that adjusting when they eat their carbohydrates would be \nadvantageous in order to make sure that they felt alert and great during the day? Maybe \nnot hypomanic but then could have a four to eight-hour a night sleep as opposed to a \ntwo to four hours a night, which is really very little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, it's not-\n- ANDREW HUBERMAN: It can't be healthy. CHRIS PALMER: It's not healthy. \nANDREW HUBERMAN: Even if you can do it and feel great, I imagine that the brain is \nsuffering. CHRIS PALMER: It is. And the body is suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And \nyour friends and family are suffering. CHRIS PALMER: The body is repairing itself with \nsleep. And so yeah, it's-- if it's somebody who is not a patient, they're not a mental health \npatient. They're not using the ketogenic diet as a mental health treatment. They're simply \ndoing it for whatever. I actually start with everything you've just outlined. Let's start with \nbehavioral measures first. And the first intervention is education. You need at least six \nhours of sleep a night. Period, end of story. That's non-negotiable. If you're not getting at \nleast six hours of sleep a night, we need to consider this a problem. So figure out a way \nto get 6 hours of sleep. For some people, that's enough, just the education. They don't \nget out of bed at 3:00 AM. It might take them an hour to fall back to sleep. They fall back \nto sleep. For most people, if you can get three nights of decent sleep in a row, the \nhypomania goes away. That is the way to extinguish it. And then they still go on feeling a \nhigh from it. They feel great. Their brain feels good in terms of memory, concentration, \nmotivation, all of those things. But they're not hypomanic anymore.

And for \nsome, I will recommend exactly what you're doing-- eat some carbohydrates in the \nevening before you're going to bed.

So I'm not going to do the carbohydrate intervention. I'm going \nto try all the other ones. But if they still can't sleep even with supplements, over the \ncounter supplements, then I'm probably going to go with prescription, sleeping \nmedicines, as a temporary stopgap to try to get them three to seven days of decent \nsleep.

And they're \nalready hypomanic. And I certainly don't want to push that further. So as long as it's \nsomebody without a history of addiction, I'm going to use a benzodiazepine or either \ncommonly called the Z medicines for sleep-- zolpidem or Ambien or something like that. \nANDREW HUBERMAN: Those tap into the opioid pathway?

So the first general observation that I'll \nmake-- I know so many couples, husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, \nheterosexual couples, who have tried the ketogenic diet to lose weight together-- \nANDREW HUBERMAN: And end up with a baby? No, I'm just kidding. [LAUGHS] \nCHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, the men have a much easier time with it than \nthe women. It's not across the board. But I know so many examples where the women \nsay I couldn't tolerate that diet. It did not make me feel better. It actually made me feel \nworse. And I think in those cases, it probably does relate to hormones. I'm aware of \nanimal models, of mice-- in particular, ketogenic diet in mouse models. One researcher \nshared with me, the thing that was striking is that the female mice never got pregnant on \nthe ketogenic diet. Whereas, the mice on the standard diet were just having babies right \nand left. And it was just shocking, the difference. On the surface, it makes sense. The \nketogenic diet is mimicking the fasting state. Women who are trying to reproduce should \nnot be fasting. If your body is in a fasting state, it probably does not want to expend \nresources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, and other things, to creating a baby \nbecause your very life is being threatened by, quote unquote, \"fasting\" or starvation. \nThat even though the ketogenic diet is a sustainable, nonstarvation diet, we're really \nusing that diet to trick the body into thinking that it is in a fasting or starvation state. And \nso just from a kind of evolutionary stance, it makes sense that women's bodies may \nactually have significant changes in hormonal status to prevent pregnancy because a \nwoman should not be having a baby when she's starving to death. I know of examples of \nwomen who are the opposite, though, who have benefited dramatically and \ntremendously from the ketogenic diet, have put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder into full \nremission. And I do actually know of one case, at least one case.

She went keto. Within \nfour months, she was pregnant. How do I make sense of that? I don't know. And \nunfortunately, I don't think we really have good control data on what does the ketogenic \ndiet do to male hormonal systems, what does the ketogenic diet do to female hormonal \nsystems. But clearly, I think changes are happening. I don't have a way to predict it, at \nleast. If somebody else has great insights, I welcome them. But I haven't seen them \npublished.

CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please \ndon't. I have a final question, which relates to something that is very much starting to get \nbuzz now-- and maybe more so for people that hang out in the Twitter space or the \nnutrition space. But there's a new class of drugs that I think initially were developed to \ntreat diabetes but are now being evaluated for their efficacy to treat obesity. And these \nare the semaglutide drugs that are involved in-- they tap into these glucagon related \nGLP-1 pathways. And it is a story that we've talked about a little bit on the podcast \nbefore. But many people, I imagine, probably haven't heard that conversation. I would \nsimply like to know what you think about these drugs. They obviously adjust the way that \nglucose and insulin are managing energy, both in the body and the brain, and can \nproduce weight loss. So that to me, when I look at the data, it's impressive. But a good \nlogical shift in diet and exercise could achieve similar weight loss. But a lot of people just \nwon't do that. So the question I have is, what are your thoughts on semaglutide and \nother GLP-- I think I might have said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related \ncompounds? And do you ever prescribe these in conjunction with these dietary shifts? \nBecause it seems to me, they would fall right in with the catalog of other approaches that \nyou have available. CHRIS PALMER: The real answer is, I am not at all an expert on \nthese medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But what are your thoughts about them? \nThey seem to be weight loss drugs, not unlike the fen-phen drugs of the '90s that then", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2756, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3cb35ee-d9bb-40a3-b85e-2ea74943524e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3cb35ee-d9bb-40a3-b85e-2ea74943524e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "99_Dr_Chris_Palmer_Diet_&_Nutrition_for_Mental_Health_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_99.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "82a26e16-3b78-4c7a-b195-18d19c4de77a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "99_Dr_Chris_Palmer_Diet_&_Nutrition_for_Mental_Health_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_99.pdf"}, "hash": "cd241918ca7573a37115b6bb3ad7234e93fdd9b4443e6b12b7461d0e87240fab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com \nwere banned because a few people didn't handle them well. CHRIS PALMER: They are. \nWe had fen-phen. And even before that, in the 1950s, and '60s, and '70s, Dexedrine-- \nANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW \nHUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, was the treatment of \nchoice for women across the United States to keep their slim figures. And we created \naddicts and all sorts of problems. But they were widely used and probably millions of \nwomen because they work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because they kill appetite. CHRIS \nPALMER: They kill appetite. My overall thoughts are this. There is zero doubt in my mind \nthat the obesity epidemic is a threat to human health and potentially the human species. \nIf it keeps going at the rate it's going, it is a threat to our species. We have to figure out \nwhat on Earth is happening, and what can we do about it. These medications, in early \nstudies, are highly effective over a year or two. That's promising. I am worried, though, \nthat we're not attacking the root cause of obesity. If the root cause of obesity ends up \nbeing some kind of poisoning of the metabolic machinery in the brain or body-- and I \nwould argue that probably relates to mitochondrial health and mitochondrial function-- I \nhave every reason to believe that taking a medication that helps you lose weight may not \nbe addressing that problem. And therefore, may not be addressing all of the negative \nhealth consequences of what we call obesity. So obesity, in it of itself, we know that \nexcess fat can become inflammatory and can cause problems, in and of itself. But I \nactually see obesity as a symptom. I see obesity as a symptom of metabolic \nderangement in the body or brain. And that is why people become obese. And that if \nwe're really going to get anywhere, we need to identify what is causing that metabolic \nderangement. Using a symptomatic treatment like a GLP-1 medication, to the best of my \nknowledge, is not addressing that core problem. And we're just ignoring it. Maybe I'll be \nwrong. And maybe these will be the wonder drug that saved the human species, and \neverybody will be thin and healthy forever and ever. I'm not hopeful, because we've \nnever-- we've had so many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine, and \nother things, we've had so many promising drugs. And at the end of the day, when you \ntry to muck with human metabolism using a single processed molecule, manmade, I \ncan't think of even one example where it's been great for large numbers of people. \nCertainly, manufacturing insulin is life-saving for people with type 1 diabetes. So that \nwould be an example. But giving massive doses of insulin to people with type 2 \ndiabetes, actually is a downward spiral. I would much rather see people with type 2 \ndiabetes control their diabetes through diet and lifestyle.

But I've been around this space long enough to know that \nindeed there there are no wonder drugs. There are drugs that certainly can help alleviate \nsymptoms in some individuals. But that lifestyle and in the case of your work-- in \nparticular, in the discussion today-- diet and, the ketogenic diet, in particular, it's clear, \ncan have incredible effects, miraculous effects, in some individuals. And positive effects \nin others that might not be of the same magnitude but nonetheless are extremely \nimportant, so on behalf of myself, and the listeners, and and certainly, just on behalf of \neverybody out there-- because everyone does need to be concerned about mental \nhealth issues, whether or not they have them and in their family themselves. Or \notherwise, because they impact everybody. Just really want to thank you for viewing the \nwork that you're doing because it really is pioneering. And it's brave. And I can see now, \nbased on our discussion, why it would work. You've given us a lot of hints into the \nunderlying mechanisms that suggest as to why it would work. And you're going to given \nus examples as to how it has worked in patients that you've worked with. And this field is \nexpanding fast. I think this is an area of psychiatry and medicine in general. Meaning, \nbehavioral, nutritional interventions, that is expanding very fast. So thank you for being \nbrave and for taking this on, and doing it in such a structured way, and for \ncommunicating it here today. And with the general public, through your book, and your \nonline presence. We will certainly point people in the direction of those valuable \nresources. Thanks so much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, I know.
