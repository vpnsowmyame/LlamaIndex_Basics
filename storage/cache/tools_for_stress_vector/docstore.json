readthatpodcast.com \nTools for Managing Stress & Anxiety | Huberman Lab Podcast #10 \nThis episode explains what stress is, and how it recruits our brain and body to react in \nspecific ways. I describe the three main types of stress, and how two of them actually \nenhance the function of our immune system making us less vulnerable to infections. I \nreview tools that allow us to control our stress in real-time, as well as tools to prevent \nlong-term stress, burnout and stress-induced illness and anxiety.

And I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and \nOphthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my \nteaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to \nbring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the \ngeneral public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's \npodcast. Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker analyzes your blood and DNA \nto give you an accurate assessment of your health and your biological age. There are \nmany things about our health that can only be analyzed from blood and DNA tests. I've \nbeen getting my blood assessed for many years now. And about a year ago, I switched \nto InsideTracker. What I like about InsideTracker is that you get all this information back \nabout metabolic factors, endocrine factors, et cetera, that are really important to your \nhealth. But unlike a lot of blood tests where you just get all the numbers back and it tells \nyou whether or not things are high, normal, or low, InsideTracker also has this really \nuseful and really easy-to-use dashboard that takes the information for your blood and \nDNA tests and points you toward particular behavioral, nutritional, and other sorts of \nprotocols that you can use to get the numbers where you want them for your health. If \nyou'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman and they will", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2502, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6bf8f10b-377f-4a53-8e4f-e01916c02aa0": {"__data__": {"id_": "6bf8f10b-377f-4a53-8e4f-e01916c02aa0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e504174a-1f8f-4184-b307-007d9f7a6ab7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "466b0664fbd76c25c5fa8e8b3b60ed3b84fb2c0fe49538104453dcca513936d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com \ngive you 25% off any of their programs. Again, their programs allow you to assess your \nhealth from the inside, things that you could just never assess from any kind of test that \ndidn't involve blood and DNA. And it also has this really interesting feature that it can \nmeasure your inner age, which is based on biology. Your chronological age, of course, is \nvery informative about your health and where you ought to be in terms of health metrics, \nbut people vary. We know people, of course, that are in their late 90s who are doing \nwell. We know people that are in their 50s who are struggling or even in their 20s. So, \nblood and DNA are the way to analyze your health. That's my belief. That's why I use \nInsideTracker. So, go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 25% off any of their \nproducts and use \"Huberman\" at checkout. Our second sponsor of today's episode is \nHelix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are ideally suited to your \nneeds for the best night's sleep possible. I switched to using a Helix mattress and Helix \npillow this last year and I'm sleeping better than I ever have before. The way that Helix \nmattresses work and the reason they're different, is that they are tailored to your \nindividual sleep style. Your sleep style can be assessed by going to their website, you \ntake a brief two-minute questionnaire quiz. Asks you questions like, do you sleep on \nyour back or your side or your stomach? Maybe you don't know or maybe you move \naround a lot during the night. It also asks you questions such as do you tend to run hot \nor wake up cold, things of that sort. And then they tailor a particular mattress to your \nsleep needs. For me, I matched to the so-called Dusk, D-U-S-K mattress. And I love it. I \nsleep better than ever. And right now, if you want to try Helix Sleep you can go to \nhelixsleep.com/huberman. And if you do that, you'll get $200 off your order plus two free \npillows. They also have a great warranty. They have a 10-year warranty on their \nmattresses. If you don't like the mattress for any reason, they'll pick it up for free from \nyour home. And they just make the whole thing really easy to try and determine whether \nor not it's right for you. So again, it's helixsleep.com/huberman to get $200 off and two \nfree pillows on your first order. Some of you have asked how you can help support the \npodcast in yet other ways, besides just checking out our sponsors. We really appreciate \nthe question and we've set up a Patreon account at patreon.com/AndrewHuberman \nwhich allows you to donate to the podcast at a variety of different levels. We have, for \ninstance, the 5-HTP, which is in honor of a serotonin. 5-HTP is the name for serotonin \nthat it allows you to donate $5 per month. We have the circadian, which as many of you, \nof course, will know is 24-hour day. So, you can donate $24 a month if you like. You can \nalso pick any value that you want.

Today's episode is going to be all about the science of emotions. The first month of \nthe podcast, we talked about sleep and wakefulness. Last month, we were talking about \nneuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change in response to experience. And this month \nwe're going to talk about these things that we call emotions. We're going to decipher \nwhat they are, how they work, how we can control them when we might not want to \ncontrol them. There are going to be four episodes on emotions. And today, we're going \nto talk in particular about something that most often is called stress. Now, you might be \nthinking, \"Wait, stress isn't an emotion.\" But stress really lies at the heart of whether or \nnot our internal experience is matched well or not to our external experience where the \nevents that are happening to us and around us. And as you'll soon, see those converge \nor combine to create what we call emotions. Now, I want to be very clear that we're \ngoing to talk about the biology of emotions, we're going to talk a little bit about some \npsychological concepts related to emotion, and we are definitely going to talk about tools \nto control what we call stress or commonly think of as stress. We're also going to clean \nup some common myths about stress. For instance, that stress impairs your immune \nsystem. That's true in certain contexts. And in other contexts, stress actually enhances \nyour immune system and makes it function better. There is going to be a lot of \ndiscussion about whether or not our internal state, whether or not we are alert or calm is \ngood or bad, depending on the circumstances. So, where we're headed here is I'd like \nyou to come away from today's episode with what I call an organizational logic, a \nframework for thinking about these things that typically we just call happy or sad or \ndepressed or anxious. And I'm going to make sure that you have tools that are grounded \nin physiology and neuroscience that will allow you to navigate this otherwise complex \nspace that we call emotions that will allow you to ground yourself better when you're \nfeeling like life is weighing on you, where you're kind of being pulled by the currents of \nlife as well as to support other people whether or not that's in a psychological practice if \nyou're a practitioner, or you have clients or children or spouses, really, to be able to", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2766, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3bdf39c4-7d02-444a-ad8c-285c44d0d6be": {"__data__": {"id_": "3bdf39c4-7d02-444a-ad8c-285c44d0d6be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "200091b4-9195-47a6-b903-edab7b341c57", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "ef69ec40c077704ff509f5424a28c1f9963fe83eb964e1deb64fd6527d7f843a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com \nsupport other people in your environment better. And the tools that I'm going to focus on \ntoday range from behavioral tools. We will talk about some of the more valuable \nsupplementation tools that are out there. And we're going to talk a little bit about things \nlike depression, PTSD, but we will be devoting entire episodes to things like depression, \nPTSD, and even attention deficit and obsessive compulsive disorder, which believe it or \nnot, although this might not surprise many of you, have a very strong emotional \ncomponent. It's just not just about compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts. It's also \nabout the emotional load of being in that state. So, I promise that today we're going to \nclean up a lot of misunderstanding. We're going to give you a lot of tools and you're \ngoing to learn a lot about the biology of how your body and brain work together. Because \nif ever there was a topic that brought together the brain and body or mind-body \nrelationship, it's stress and emotions. It's also the positive emotions. When we feel \nsomething, whether or not we're super happy or just feeling kind of pleasant or we are \nfeeling stressed, anxious, and overwhelmed, it isn't just in our head. It's also in our body. \nAnd as you may recall, the nervous system, which includes the brain and the eyes and \nthe spinal cord, but also all the connections with the organs of the body includes the \nbrain and body. And those organs of the body, your gut, and your liver, and your spleen, \nthey're also communicating with the brain. So, I look forward to a day, in fact, when we \nno longer think about neuroscience as just the brain. And many neuroscientists now also \nthink about the body, of course. And the brain controls the body, but the body is also \nhaving a very profound and concrete influence on the brain. I think up until recently, \npeople would hear about kind of brain-body and always think about mindfulness. We're \nactually not going to talk that much about mindfulness at all today. Mindfulness is kind of \na vague concept, in fact. When you think about mindfulness, it's good to take the \nopposite. What's the opposite of mindfulness? Would be mindlessness. Well, all of a \nsudden we're into territory that isn't really easy for one person to describe their \nexperience or to help others with their experience. Today, we're going to talk about \nobjective tools that match the brain-body experience or separate the brain-body \nexperience in ways that leverage your ability to lean into life better, to feel better, literally \nto just feel better about what you're experiencing, and believe it or not, to be able to \ncontrol your emotions when that's appropriate. This isn't about becoming robotic. This \nisn't about trying not to feel human. This is actually about being able to lean into life \nbetter as a consequence of being able to control some of your inner real estate.

So, it's to place you in a greater position of power. And \nso, let's get started in deciphering what is stress, what are emotions, and why did I batch \nstress and emotions into one discussion today?  \n \n00:10:29 Stress: The (Falsely Narrow) Animal Attack Narrative  \n \nOkay. So, what is stress? We hear all the time that stress is bad. We hear people saying \nthey're really stressed out. What is stress? You've all presumably heard the arguments \nor the framework that stress is this horrible ancient carryover over from times in which \nhumans were pursued by animals or other human predators and that whenever we feel \nwhat we call stress or feel stressed out, that it's just this unfortunate invasion of \nsomething that we no longer need in modern life, that this was designed for when we \nwere being attacked by bears or tigers or lions or whatever it is. And gosh, what an \nunfortunate thing. And we have so many creature comforts nowadays, but we have not \neliminated this stress. Almost as if it was like an organ or a system in our body that was \nbad for us, that we're stuck with just because of the species that we are. But first of all, \nall species experience stress. And I think that it's fair to say even though I wasn't there, \nthat yes, in fact, throughout our evolutionary history, we were vulnerable to animal attack \nand other human attacks on a regular basis up until a point where we started developing \nweapons and structures and fire and other things that allow us to protect ourselves \nbetter from those animals and invaders of various kinds. But it is entirely naive for us to \nthink that in ancient times, ancient times being kind of loose term for previous on \nmedieval times, 100 years ago, 1000 years ago, 10,000 years ago, of course, there were \ninfidelities, right? Partners cheated. People died. In fact, before the advent of phones, \nwhich we're going to talk about today, you can imagine that someone might head off on \na hunt or to go visit a relative and never come back and you would never know why. \nThat would be very stressful. So, there was psychosocial stress. There was the stress of \nlosing loved ones. There was the stress of cold, of famine. There was the stress \nprobably also of just worry. This idea that ancient versions of humans 1000 years ago, \n100 years ago didn't worry, I think that is entirely inconsistent with everything we know \nabout the structure of the human brain 100 years, 1000 years ago. So, all the problems \nthat we're struggling with existed forever. It's just that stress at its core is a generalized \nsystem. It wasn't designed for tigers attacking us or people attacking us. It's a system to \nmobilize other systems in the brain and body. That's what stress really is. It's designed", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2826, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f73df72-45e6-4ada-bdda-2c26af007953": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f73df72-45e6-4ada-bdda-2c26af007953", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e2f95cf4-d8a8-4ab9-bca9-808fde6f4861", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "ea521a085f64ede98017ac06237e458a8b001c60785e8fe7a81738d994425821", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com \nto be generic. And that's the most important thing that I'd like you to understand today, is \nthat the system that governs what we call stress is generic. It wasn't designed for one \nthing. And that gives it a certain advantage in taking over the state of our brain and body, \nbut it also gives you, all of us an advantage in controlling it because it's based on hard-\nwired biological mechanisms and there are hard-wired biological mechanisms, meaning \ncells and chemicals and pathways and tissues that exist in you right now that require no \nneuroplasticity that allow you to put a brake on stress. And so, we're going to talk about \nthose. So, you have a system for stress and you have a system for distress that are \nbaked into you. They were genetically encoded. And you were born with them and you \nstill have them now. So, if you're alive and listening, you have the capacity to control \nyour stress. And today, I'm going to talk about ways that you can control your stress, not \njust by doing some offline practice of meditation or breath work or something like that, \nbut real-time tools. Tools that allow you to push back on stress when stress hits in real \ntime. This is something that my lab works actively on in developing and testing these \ntools  \n \n00:14:31 The Stress RESPONSE: Generic, Channels blood, Biases Action  \n \nand evolving these tools. And there are other laboratories that do this as well. So, let's \ntalk about the stress response. And by doing that, you will understand exactly why the \ntools I'm going to give you work. For those of you that are saying, \"Wait, I just want the \ntools. Just give me a summary,\" trust me, if you understand mechanism, you are going \nto be in a far better position to incorporate these tools, to teach these tools to others, and \nto modify them as your life circumstances change. If you'd like the cheat sheet or you \njust want the one-page PDF, eventually we'll get that stuff out to people, but it's really \nimportant to understand the underlying mechanism. Okay. So, what is stress? Well, let's \njust distinguish between stressors, which are the things that stress us out, and stress, \nwhich is the psychological and physiological response to stressors. I'm mainly going to \ntalk about stress, which is your response to things. Let's be clear about what we already \nknow, which is that stressors can be psychological or they can be physical. Okay?

So, what happens when \nthe stress response hits? Let's talk about the immediate or what we call the acute stress \nresponse. We could also think of this as short-term stress. So, you have a collection of \nneurons. They have a name. It's called the sympathetic chain ganglia. And it has nothing \nto do with sympathy. Sympa means together. And there's a group of neurons that start \nright about at your neck and run down to about your navel, a little bit lower, and those \nare called the sympathetic chain ganglia. You don't need to memorize that name. There \nwill not be a quiz. But it's important to know that in the middle of your body, you have a \nchain of neurons that when something stresses us out, either in our mind or because \nsomething enters our environment and we see something that stresses us out, that we \ndon't like heights if you're afraid of heights, somebody you dislike walks into the room, et \ncetera, that chain of neurons becomes activated like a bunch of dominoes falling on all \nat once. It's very fast. When that happens, those neurons release a neuromodulator \nneurochemical that I've talked about before on this podcast called acetylcholine. They \nrelease that at various sites within the body. Now, this is important because normally, \nacetylcholine would be used to move muscles. Actually, every time we move a muscle, \npick up a cup of coffee, write with a pen, walk down the street, it's spinal neurons \nconnecting to muscle and releasing acetylcholine. So, in the brain it's involved in focus \nand it muscles is involved in making muscles twitch. But if we were stressed, we \nwouldn't want all our muscles to contract at once because we would just be kind of like \nparalyzed like this in what tonic activation, as it's called. We wouldn't want that. \nSomething called tetanus, believe it or not. because the tetanus toxin will cause that kind \nof rigor of the entire body. You do not want that. When those neurons are activated, \nacetylcholine is released, but there are some other neurons for the aficionados out there. \nThey're called the postganglionic neurons. Those ones respond to that acetylcholine and \nthen they release epinephrine, which is the equivalent to adrenaline. So, we have this \nsystem where it's very fast whenever we're stressed, the core of our body, these \nneurons down the middle of our body release these chemicals and then there's \nadrenaline or epinephrine released at particular organs and acts in particular ways. \nWe're going down into the weeds here. So just stay with me because it's going to make \na lot of sense and you will appreciate having this knowledge in hand. That epinephrine \nacts in two different ways. Some things like the muscles of your legs and your heart and \nother things that need to be active when you're stressed, they have a certain kind of \nreceptor which is called the beta receptor.

They get bigger and blood rushes in to our legs. \nThe heart rate speeds up. Lots of things happen that get activated. And at the same \ntime, that epinephrine activates other receptors on certain tissues that we don't need. \nThe ones involved in digestion, reproduction, and things of that sort that are luxuries for \nwhen things are going well, not things to pay attention to when we're stressed. And that \nbinds to other receptors that contract the blood vessels. So, basically the stress \nresponse, this is the key phrase here, the stress response A, is generic, I said that \nbefore, and B, it basically pushes certain systems to be activated and other systems to \nnot be activated. So, the stress response is two-pronged. It's a yes for certain things and \nit's a no, you may not right now for other things. So, that's the key thing to understand \nabout the stress response. That's why your heart speeds up. That's why you feel blood \nin certain organs and tissues of your body, but not in others. That's why your throat goes \ndry because it turns out that when you get stressed, the salivary glands are shut down. \nThere's a lot less blood flow to the neurons that control salivation. And so, you're going \nto start swallowing. You feel like your throat is getting dry. There are a lot of different \neffects. I'm not going to list them all off, but basically, you are activated in ways that \nsupport you moving. So, that's the third thing. It's first of all, it's generic. Second of all, \nthe stress response, activate certain things and shuts down other features of our body. \nAnd then it's a sense of agitation that makes you want to move. And that's because \nfundamentally, the stress response is just this generic thing that says do something. And \nmovement in this case can either be the bias to move in terms of action, or it can be the \nbias to say something. When we are stressed, we are more likely to say something that \nprobably we shouldn't say. We are more likely to move. And if you're trying to suppress \nmovement, you'll feel that as a tremor. You're going to feel agitated and that's because it \nwas designed to move you. So, this is important because if you want to control stress, \nyou need to learn how to work with that agitation.  \n \n00:21:08 Tools to Actually Control Stress: Reduce Alertness or Increase Calm   \n \nI'd like to give you a tool at this point, because I think if we go any further with a lot more \nscience, people are going to begin to wonder if this is just going to be a kind of standard \nuniversity lecture about the stress response.

So, we're \ntaking the podium or we're sitting down at a Zoom call, and all of a sudden we're feeling \nflushed. We're feeling like our heart is racing. We're feeling a little too alert. We're feeling \na little worked up and we want to calm down. As far as I am aware of, the best tools to \nreduce stress quickly, so-called real-time tools are going to be tools that have a direct \nline to the so-called autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is a \nname given to the kind of general features of alertness or calmness in the body. \nTypically, it means automatic. Although we do have some control over it at certain what \nso-called leavers are entry points. Here's what doesn't work to control stress. Telling \nyourself to calm down. In fact, that tends to just exacerbate stress. Telling someone else \nto calm down also tends to exacerbate their stress. If you want to reduce the magnitude \nof the stress response, the best thing you can do is activate the other system in the body \nwhich is designed for calming and relaxation. And that system is called the \nparasympathetic nervous system. Because as I mentioned before, the neurons that \ncontrol stress run from about your neck to your navel. The parasympathetic neurons, \npara just means near, exist in, they're some of the cranial nerves. So, it's kind of left \nneck and lower brainstem. Kind of back of the brain and in the neck and in the pelvic \narea. And the parasympathetic nervous system is really interesting because especially \nthe cranial nerves, the ones that are up in the brainstem and in the neck area, those \nhave a direct line to various features of your face, in particular, the eyes. They control \nthings like eye movements, pupil dilation, things of that sort, as well as the tongue, the \nfacial muscles, et cetera. The parasympathetic nervous system, many people don't \nrealize this, is the system by which we control the face and the eyes, and to some \nextent, our airway, the trachea. And it's these neurons that reside within the pelvic area. \nNow, the neurons within the pelvic area are involved in control of the genitals, the \nbladder, and the rectum. And those don't have a direct line. You don't have a direct way \nto control those. It actually has to go from brain to spinal cord and then out to those \norgans. Whereas the parasympathetic nervous system has certain entry points or what \nI'll call leavers that will allow you to push back on the stress response in real time and \ndiminish it and feel more relaxed really quickly.

And the tool that at least to my knowledge is the fastest and most thoroughly \ngrounded in physiology and neuroscience for calming down in a self-directed way is \nwhat's called the physiological sigh, S-I-G-H. Now, some of you might've heard me talk \nabout this on previous podcasts, but I'm going to explain this in the context of how \nrespiration in general is used to calm us down. And turns out you're all doing this all the \ntime, but you are doing it involuntarily. And when you stress, you tend to forget that you \ncan also activate these systems voluntarily. This is an extremely powerful set of \ntechniques that we know from scientific studies that are being done in my lab, Jack \nFeldman's lab at UCLA, and others now that are very, very useful for reducing your \nstress response in real time. And here's how they work. These days, there seems to be \na lot of interest in breath work. Breath work typically, is when you go and you sit down or \nyou lie down and you deliberately breathe in a particular way for a series of minutes in \norder to shift your physiology, access some states. And it does have some utility that \nwe're going to talk about, that is not what I'm talking about now. What I'm talking about \nwhen I refer to physiological sighs, is the very real medical school textbook relationship \nbetween the brain, the body, and the body as it relates to the breathing apparati, \nmeaning the diaphragm and lungs and the heart. Let's take the hallmark of the stress \nresponse. The heart starts beating faster. Blood is shuttled to the big muscles of the \nbody to move you away from whatever it is the stressor is or just make you feel like you \nneed to move or talk. Your face goes flushed, et cetera. Heart rate, many of us feel is \ninvoluntary. Just kind of functions whether or not we're moving fast or moving slow. If \nyou think about it, it's not really purely autonomic because you can speed up your heart \nrate by running or you can slow it down by slowing down your run. You can move to a \nwalk or lie down. But that's indirect control. There is however, a way in which you can \nbreathe that directly controls your heart rate through the interactions between the \nsympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system. Here's how it works. When you \ninhale, so whether or not it's through the nose or through the mouth, this skeletal muscle \nthat's inside your body called the diaphragm, it moves down. And that's because the \nlungs expand, the diaphragm moves down. Your heart actually gets a little bit bigger in \nthat expanded space. There's more space for the heart. So, not your emotional heart \ngetting bigger. I'm talking about your actual physical heart getting a little bit bigger. The \nvolume grows. And as a consequence, whatever blood is in there is now at a lower", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2933, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a1c75d5-4b28-44c7-a7d5-12de01497f95": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a1c75d5-4b28-44c7-a7d5-12de01497f95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39c6e9fd-bf6a-4dfa-af8e-6ac52ec96f72", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "902ba89832f50b77546ccf47c2c6bea3f14032a3d87b1a1ac89b9728e9865fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com \nvolume or moving a little bit more slowly in that larger volume than it was before you \ninhaled. Okay? So more space, heart gets bigger. Blood moves more slowly. And there's \na little group of neurons called the sinoatrial node in the heart that registers, believe it or \nnot, those neurons pay attention to the rate of blood flow through the heart and send a \nsignal up to the brain that blood is moving more slowly through the heart. The brain then \nsends a signal back to the heart to speed the heart up. So, what this means is if you \nwant your heart to beat faster, inhale longer, inhale more vigorously than your exhales. \nNow, there are a variety of ways that one could do that, but it doesn't matter if it's \nthrough the nose or through the mouth. If your inhales are longer than your exhales, \nyou're speeding up your heart. If your inhales are more vigorous, so even if your inhales \nare shorter than your exhales, you are speeding up your heart rate. Now, the opposite is \nalso true. If you want to slow your heart rate down, so stress response hits, you want to \nslow your heart rate down, what you want to do is again, capitalize on this relationship \nbetween the body, meaning the diaphragm and the heart and the brain. Here's how it \nworks. When you exhale, the diaphragm moves up, which makes the heart a little bit \nsmaller. It actually gets a little more compact. Blood flows more quickly through that \ncompact space sort of like just a pipe getting smaller. The sinoatrial node registers that \nblood is going more quickly, sends a signal up to the brain. And the parasympathetic \nnervous system, some neurons in your brain stem send a signal back to the heart to \nslow the heart down. So, if you want to calm down quickly, you need to make your \nexhales longer and or more vigorous than your inhales. Now, the reason this is so \nattractive as a tool for controlling stress is that it works in real time. This doesn't involve a \npractice that you have to go and sit there and do anything separate from life. And we are \ngoing to get to emotion. Emotions and stress happen in real time. And so, while it's \nwonderful to have a breath work practice or to have the opportunity to get a massage or \nsit in a sauna or do whatever it is that you do in order to set your stress controls in the \nright direction, having tools that you can reach to in real time that require no learning, I \nmean, I had to teach it to you, you had to learn that, but it doesn't require any plasticy to \nactivate these pathways. So, if you're feeling stressed, you still need to inhale, of course, \nbut you need to lengthen your exhales.

It's now been explored at the neuro-\nbiological level and mechanistically in far more detail by Jack Feldman's lab at UCLA. \nAlso Mark Krasnow's lab at Stanford. And the physiological sigh is something that \nhumans and animals do anytime they are about to fall asleep. You also do it throughout \nsleep from time to time when carbon dioxide, which we'll talk about in a moment, builds \nup too much in your system. And the physiological sigh is something that people \nnaturally start doing when they've been crying and they're trying to recover some air or \ncalm down when they've been sobbing very hard or when they are in claustrophobic \nenvironments. However, the amazing thing about this thing that we call the diaphragm, \nthe skeletal muscle, is that it's an internal organ that you can control voluntarily, unlike \nyour spleen or your heart or your pancreas where you can't just say, \"Oh, I want to make \nmy pancreas turn out a little more insulin right now. I'm just going to do that with my mind \ndirectly.\" You can't do that. You can do that by smelling a really good donut or \nsomething, but you can't just do it directly. You can move your diaphragm intentionally, \nright? You can do it anytime you want. And it'll run in the background if you're not \nthinking about it. So, this incredible pathway that goes from brain to diaphragm through \nwhat's called the phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C. Phrenic. The phrenic nerve innervates \nthe diaphragm. You can control anytime you want. You can double up your inhales or \ntriple up your inhales. You can exhale more than your inhales. Whatever you want to do. \nSuch an incredible organ. And the physiological sigh is something that we do \nspontaneously. But when you're feeling stressed, you can do a double inhale, [inhales \ndeeply] [exhales] long exhale. Now, I just told you a minute ago that if you inhale more \nthan you exhale, you're going to speed the heart rate up, which would promote more \nstress and activation. Now I'm telling you to do a double inhale-exhale in order to calm \ndown. And the reason is the double inhale-exhale which is the physiological sigh takes \nadvantage of the fact that when we do a double inhale, even if the second inhale is \nsneaking in just a tiny bit more air, because it's kind of hard to get to deep inhales back \nto back, you do big deep inhale and then another little ones sneaking it in, the little sacks \nin your lungs. If you only have the lungs. Your lungs are just two big bags, but you've got \nmillions of little sacks throughout the lungs that actually make the surface area of your \nlungs as big as a tennis court. It's amazing if we were to just spread out. Those tend to \ncollapse as we get stressed. And carbon dioxide builds up in our bloodstream and that's \none of the reasons we feel agitated as well. So, and it makes us very jittery.

And \nthen when you do the long exhale, that long exhale is now much more effective at \nreading your body and bloodstream of carbon dioxide, which relaxes you very quickly. \nMy lab in collaboration with David Spiegel's lab, David's the Associate Chair of \nPsychiatry at Stanford, are doing a study right now exploring how physiological sighs \nand other patterns of breathing done deliberately can modulate the stress response and \nother things related to emotionality. Those work are ongoing. I want to be clear those \nstudies aren't done. But it's very clear from work in our labs, from work in Jack \nFeldman's lab and others, that the physiological sigh is the fastest, hardwired way for us \nto eliminate this stressful response in our body quickly in real time. And so, I'm excited to \ngive you this tool because I think most people have heard that mindfulness and \nmeditation is good, exercise is good for us, we all need to be getting enough sleep, et \ncetera, but life happens. And when you find yourself in a position where you are more \nalert and activated than you would like to be, regardless of whether or not the stressor is \nrelationship-based or it's financial or it's physical or anything like that, you can look to the \nphysiological sigh because it bypasses a very important feature of how we function, \nwhich is that it's very hard to control the mind with the mind, especially when we are in \nheightened states of activation. When you're very alert or very sleepy, it is very hard to \nuse these so-called top-down mechanisms of intention and gratitude and all these things \nthat are really powerful tools when we are not super activated and stressed or not super \ntired. But when we are anywhere in the range of very alert and stressed to very sleepy, \nphysiological sighs are a powerful way of bringing our level of so-called autonomic \nactivation, which just means our level of alertness down.

There's actually something \ncalled the vasovagal response, where people will stand up or they'll get up in the middle \nof the night to use the bathroom and then all of a sudden, they'll collapse, they'll faint. \nThat's because the heart rate was reduced too much. Some people will see blood or \nthey'll see something really troubling and stressful and they'll pass out. That's an over-\nactivation or an acceleration of the calming response. They're not so stressed that they \nkind of fall off the cliff of stress. They get so stressed that the rebound mechanism for \ncalming themselves down goes too high, too fast. They calmed down too fast and they \ncollapse and faint. And so, be aware that if you're going to use the physiological sigh or \nexhale-emphasized breathing to calm down, that your heart rate will take about 20 to 30 \nseconds to come down to baseline. And you may need to repeat the physiological sigh a \nfew times. So, that's an important note about the use of breathing to control levels of \nstress. The other thing is that when you decide to look to the body to control the mind, it \ndoes something else that's very powerful. When you are stressed in your mind and body, \nso you're feeling really agitated, activated, and worried, and you use a tool like the \nphysiological sigh or exhale-emphasized breathing, you will notice that then your brain \nand your mind becomes more available for controlling the stress response and reacting \nto it.

And what you'll find is that most breath work protocols, the kind of stuff \nthat's done away from real life, that you set aside time and decide to do quote unquote, \nbreath work, most of that works such that if you're doing inhales that are longer and \nmore vigorous than exhales, it tends to be activating and alert you. If you're doing \nexhales that are longer and more vigorous than the inhales, it tends to put you to sleep. \nAnd many of the protocols that are out there from laboratories and that populate the \ninternet and wellness sites and whatnot, if it's exhale-emphasized breathing, oftentimes \nhas been used as a tool for trying to teach people to fall asleep.

A note about \nnasal versus mouth breathing, there's a plethora of information out there now  \n \n00:37:57 Nasal Breathing For Cosmetic, Immune and Performance Enhancement  \n \nbecause of James Nestor's book, \"Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art,\" which came \nout this last year. Excellent book. As well as \"Jaws\" which is from Sandra Kahn, Paul \nEhrlich with a foreword by Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky. So, a collection of \npeople from Stanford. Jared Diamond is not at Stanford, but the rest are. And some \nheavy hitters on that book, which is about the benefits of nasal breathing. And in many \ncases, nasal breathing is more advantageous than mouth breathing for all sorts of \nthings. Cosmetic features of the face, especially in kids, warding off infection, et cetera. \nWith the physiological sigh, the best way to do it would be double inhale through the \nnose, exhale through the mouth. But if you can't, and you can only do that through your \nmouth, just do it through your mouth. If want to do all through your nose, do it through \nyour nose. This anchors back to some underlying neurology or neuroscience.  \n \n00:38:46 Two Breathing Centers In The Brain  \n \nSo, for those of you that want to know, you have two breathing centers. One that's \ninvolved in rhythmic breathing for inhales followed by exhales, followed by inhales \nfollowed by exhales. The so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus named after a bottle of wine \nand discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA and a nearby nucleus called the parafacial \nnucleus also discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA. And the parafacial nucleus is \ninvolved in any time you double up the inhales or double up the exhales. It was designed \nso that you could breathe while you're speaking because you can't always go inhale, \nexhale, inhale, exhale when you're speaking. So, I tell you this, not to overwhelm you \nwith knowledge, but just know that when you double up your inhales or you double up \nyour exhales, you are activating this parafacial nucleus. And it has other cool effects. \nBecause it's located near the neurons that control the face, it also has a tendency to \nrelax the jaw. There's some interplay between the neurons that control the speaking stuff \nand the stuff for your tongue.

Maybe that means not \nsaying certain things when we're stressed, and just generally to relax. And so, this brings \nus back to the neuroscience of this parasympathetic nervous system. This calming \nsystem that's been genetically encoded into us that we all have, regardless of who our \nparents are, which is that the neurons that control all this stuff, the face, the eyes, et \ncetera, are all working together. And that's why when we get stressed, it's hard for us to \nspeak or we tend to jitter and these kinds of things. Just like all the neurons that cause \nstress in the center of the spinal cord are working together to get our body activated. \nOkay, lot of science today. You've now got the physiological sigh as a tool. You know the \nexhale-emphasized breathing will slow your heart down and inhale-emphasized \nbreathing will speed your heart up. So, let's think about something now.  \n \n00:40:39 The 3 Types of Stress: Short, Medium and Long-Term   \n \nLet's think about stress from not whether or not it's acute or chronic, whether or not it's \ngood for us or bad for us, but on three different timescales. Because then we can arrive \nat what this is all about as it relates to emotions. Because trust me, this has everything \nto do with emotions and whether or not you're functioning well emotionally or you're not \nfunctioning well emotionally, whether or not you're coping or not coping. So, those are \ntypically psychological terms and psychological discussions. We are entering this \nthrough the portal of physiology. The stuff of medical textbooks. And we will arrive at the \npsychology soon, but I really want you to understand the difference between the three \nkinds of stress on three different timescales, short-term, medium-term, and long-term, \nand what it's good for and what it's bad for. I think we've all heard that stress is bad for \nus. We've seen these pictures intended to frighten us. And indeed they are frightening. \nYou see the nice really plump brain on the left. It says healthy or control. And then you \nsee the brain that says stressed above it on the right and it's like withered, where we see \nthat the hippocampus and area involved in memory is smaller. People that are stressed. \nWe see that the Alzheimer's brain is made worse by stress. That people who have a \npredisposition to schizophrenia, when they get stressed, higher incidence of \nschizophrenia episodes. You hear that addicts will relapse when they're stressed.

And it's very important, but I think we've all heard now so many \ntimes that stress is bad.  \n \n00:42:10 Positive Effects of Short-Term Stress: Immunity and Focus  \n \nBut in that conversation, unfortunately, it's eclipsed some of the really positive things that \nstress does for us in the short-term. So, stress can be short-term, medium-term, or long-\nterm. Long-term stress is indeed bad for all the reasons I just mentioned and many \nothers. But what's never actually been discussed is what stress is so terrific for, positive \nfor in the short-term. And I think we tend to overlook the important question, which is \nwhat is short-term and what is long-term? No one ever bothers to tell us what is chronic, \nwhat is acute. Right? Is it five minutes? Is it five days? Is it for the duration of final \nexams? Or is it for the duration of a senior thesis in college? No one actually draws \nboundaries around this stuff or even general guidelines. And so, it's become a bit of a \nmess, frankly, to try and decipher this whole space around stress. So, I'm going to try \nand clean some of this up for you based on what we know from the scientific data. First \nof all, acute stress, when the stress response hits, that is good for your immune system. \nI know that might be a tough pill to swallow, but it's absolutely true. In fact, stress often \ncomes in the form of bacterial or viral infection. And the stress response is in part \norganized to combat bacterial and viral infection. There are pathways from the same \nbrain centers that activate these neurons in your spinal cord to make you feel like you \nwant to move. There are other neurons in your brain that activate things like your spleen, \nwhich will deploy killer cells to go out and scavenge for incoming bacteria and viruses \nand try and eat them up and kill them. So, short-term stress and the release of \nadrenaline in particular or epinephrine, same thing, adrenaline and epinephrine, is good \nfor combating infection. And this to me is just not discussed enough. So, that's why I'm \ndiscussing it here. And it relates to a particular tool that many of you ask about, but I \ndon't often get the opportunity to talk about in such an appropriate context. It's not that \nit's ever inappropriate to talk about, but what I'm about to talk about now is the use of, \nagain, respiration breathing to somewhat artificially activate the stress response. And \nthat will accomplish two things. Okay? I'll return to medium and long-term stress, but I \nwant to say short-term stress is good because the dilation of the pupils, the changes in \nthe optics of the eyes, the quickening of the heart rate, the sharpening of your cognition. \nAnd in fact that short-term stress brings certain elements of the brain online that allow", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2832, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9347b6de-be02-4cb2-b98a-a45d547e9eb7": {"__data__": {"id_": "9347b6de-be02-4cb2-b98a-a45d547e9eb7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e3c114a9-ecb2-4443-990a-fdff59f2f077", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "76d2fb3370c4e05a005a78e50c3024e6d9047b8ef5e61e7adb7c8494700da9d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com \nyou to focus. Now, it narrows your focus. You're not good at seeing the so-called big \npicture, but it narrows your focus. It allows you to do these, what I call duration path \noutcome types of analysis. It allows you to evaluate your environment, evaluate what \nyou need to do. It primes your whole system for better cognition. It primes your immune \nsystem to combat infection. And that all makes sense when you think about that the fact \nthat famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, all of this stuff liberates \na response in the body that's designed to get you to fight back against whatever stressor \nthat happens to be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, the stress response is \ngeneric.  \n \n00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells   \n \nThe tool takes advantage of the fact that when adrenaline is released in the body from \nthe adrenals, it has the effect of also liberating a lot of these killer cells from the immune \norgans, in particular from the spleen, but from elsewhere as well, and interactions with \nthe lymphatic system that combat infection. The way this works in the real world is best \ncaptured by a study that can be mapped back to so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now, \nWim Hof breathing is so named after the so-called \"Iceman,\" Wim Hof. Wim Hof, of \ncourse, being this Dutch. He, I think he has self-titled Daredevil. And indeed he has \nmany, many Guinness Book of World Records for things like swimming under icebergs \nand going up Kilimanjaro in his shorts and crossing the desert without water, et cetera. \nThings that are quite dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.

But there are two components to a sort of \nbreathing protocol  \n \n00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing IS Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation   \n \nthat he developed that was based also on what's called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O. \nSo, before Wim, there was Tummo breathing. And many people call this now super \noxygenation breathing. Although the breath work aficionados will probably say, well, it's \nnot super oxygenation because you're also blowing an awful lot of carbon dioxide. What \nI'm talking about here, regardless of whether or not it's called Wim Hof, Tummo, or super \noxygenation, is rapid deliberate breathing. So, it's deliberate hyperventilation.

Well, deliberate hyperventilation done for maybe 25 cycles.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2518, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "162dc18a-1ef6-4fe7-a05f-46f2e04e624a": {"__data__": {"id_": "162dc18a-1ef6-4fe7-a05f-46f2e04e624a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b4284610-453f-4dab-ac40-e115b3c26d75", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "3e38a29b4a53ef4568daa4b1f958b569e37e2f2b3f1a745f9058a52e5d1a17cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com \nSo inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, it's done in through the nose \nout through the mouth. Although sometimes it's just through the mouth. If you do that for \n15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, you will feel very alert. People who have anxiety will \nfeel anxious. They might even have an anxiety attack. However, we need to ask why \nthat kind of breathing feels that way. And it's because that pattern of breathing, rapid \nmovements of the diaphragm will liberate adrenaline from the adrenals. So, it's the \nrelease of adrenaline. I mentioned that Wim is also called \"The Iceman.\" Well, that's \nbecause he actually discovered this pattern of breathing, somewhat. And again, it maps \nback to Tummo breathing by going into cold water. When you go into cold water, that too \nis a stressor and you liberate adrenaline in response to cold water. So, if you get into an \nice bath or a cold shower, you will immediately release adrenaline from your adrenals. \nNow, there are all sorts of things related to this about psychological control and stress \nthresholds that we'll talk about, but I really want people to understand that when \nadrenaline is released in the body, you are in a better position to combat infections. And \nso, whether or not you breathe very quickly in these cycles of 25 breaths and regardless \nof what you call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline is released. If you take a cold shower, \nadrenaline is released. If you go into an ice bath deliberately, and even if you do it non-\ndeliberately, adrenaline is released. You are mimicking the stress response. And that \nadrenaline serves to suppress or combat incoming infections. And this was beautifully \nshown in a study that was published in a very fine journal, the \"Proceedings of the \nNational Academy of Sciences for the US.\" It's literally called \"Proceedings of the \nNational Academy of USA\" to distinguish it from other proceedings of other national \nacademies in other countries. The way the experiment went is that people were injected \nwith endotoxin or in some cases they were injected with a bacterial wall that mimics \ninfection. It gives you a fever. It makes you feel nauseous. It makes you feel sick. It is \nnot pleasant. Half of the people did a particular pattern of breathing that looked very \nmuch like the pattern of breathing I described a moment ago of doing 25 deep inhales \nand exhales followed by an exhale holding their breath. Then repeating 25 inhales, \nexhales holding their breath. So, this would look something like this, or if you're listening, \nit sounds like [inhaling and exhaling]. 25, 30 times, you'll start feeling heated up. You'll \nstart feeling the adrenaline response. You're liberating adrenaline in your body. Then \nexhale, hold your breath for 15 seconds and then repeat. And then typically, after doing \nthree or four rounds of that, they would inhale very deeply and hold their breath. Now, I \nwant to emphasize never ever, ever do this anywhere near water.

And indeed the inflammation response looks \nhorrible, it sounds horrible, but it's a great thing in the short-term. You want to have that \ntissue marked as in trouble and you want the body and brain to react to it. So, if you're \ngetting peaks in stress from time to time throughout your day or throughout your week, \nyou are in a better position to combat infection.

It \nis a powerful nootropic. I get asked about nootropics. The most powerful nootropic or \nsmart drug is stress. It's the concern of failure. It's the desire to do well. It's the \nimpending deadline. It's the, \"Oh my gosh, I have to do this thing now or I'm going to \nfail.\" That is the best nootropic you will ever find. That combined with a good night's \nsleep, which we'll talk about. But we spent a whole month on sleep. So, I don't want to \nbacktrack too much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great.

I would just kind of use a rule of thumb. When \nyou are no longer able to achieve good sleep, what good sleep means to you, and \nplease see the episodes on sleep if you want more about tools to sleep, when you are \nno longer able to achieve good sleep, you are now moving from acute stress to chronic \nstress.

Physiological sigh is one. \nIf we're going to activate our stress response intentionally by ice baths, cold showers, \ncyclic hyperoxygenated breathing, aka Tummo breathing or Wim Hof breathing, we also \nneed to learn how to press the brake.

We might think of that as long-term stress. There are times in life \nwhen we are just dealing with a lot. Okay? This particular quarter, I happened to be \ndirecting a course, I'm doing the lab, I'm doing this. I enjoy all these things immensely, \nbut I'm kind of near my threshold. I'm near the point where any additional thing, like I \ncouldn't log onto a website the other day and it felt like the most intense thing in the \nworld at that moment.

Well, stress threshold is \nactually our ability to cognitive re-regulate what's going on in our body. So, we all hear \nso much about we need to unify our mind and body. We need to be at one with our mind \nand body or whatever. Now I realize I'm kind of poking fun at some of the new agey \nlanguage, but the reason I poke fun is not because I don't think it has value, but it has no \nspecificity. What does that mean? I mean, I think I'm always in my body. I've never \nfortunately looked across the room and seen my arm over there or my leg over there. I'm \nconnected to my body.

A lot of stress inoculation, a lot of managing medium-\nterm stress on the timescale of weeks or maybe even a couple months, so we're not \ntalking about years of stress, a lot of that has to do with raising our stress threshold. It's \nabout capacity. And there are very simple tools, excellent tools that will allow us to \nmodulate our capacity for stress. And they look a lot like the tools I just described. They \ninvolve placing oneself deliberately into a situation where our adrenaline is increased \nsomewhat not to the extreme. And then when we feel flooded with adrenaline, and \nnormally we would panic, it's about cognitively, mentally, emotionally calming ourselves \nand being comfortable with that response in our body. So, unlike trying to unify the mind \nand body and make it all calm or make it all alert, this is about dissociating mind and \nbody in a healthy way. And what would this look like? Well, this is something I actually \ndo as a practice because I mentioned before, you can use physiological sighs in real \ntime, you can use the cyclic hyperoxygenation breathing to combat infection if you're \nfeeling kind of run down. And there's also a way in which you can use things like cold \nshowers, or if you exercise and you bring your heart rate up very high, you kind of go \ninto that high-intensity realm where your heart is beating a little bit harder than you're \ncomfortable with and that you're just you feel, some people think it's lactic acid. No one \ncan agree on this what the burn is, whether or not it's lactic acids or it's buildup of \nhydrogen or whatever. I don't want to get into that, but we're all familiar with the intense \nfeeling of your muscles kind of burning because you're working very hard physically. The \nkey in those moments is to learn to relax the mind while the body is very activated. And \nwhat that tends to do, there's a limited amount of research on this, but what that tends to \ndo is it tends to create a situation where what once felt like a lot feels manageable. \nOkay? That you've raised your stress threshold or your stress capacity.

And then what \nyou want to do is you want to actually try and calm the mind while your body is in this \nheightened state of activation. And the best way that I'm aware to do that,  \n \n00:59:50 Use Vision to Calm the Mind When the Body Is Agitated  \n \nagain goes back to physiology, not psychology. When we are stressed, our pupils dilate. \nThe effect of that pupil dilation is to create tunnel vision. It literally narrows our view of \nthe visual world. We no longer see in Panorama. And there's some other effects as well. \nBut that's because the visual system through this cranial nerve system that I described \nbefore is tethered and is part of this autonomic nervous system. By deliberately dilating \nyour gaze, meaning not moving your head and eyes around, but by deliberately going \nfrom tunnel vision to broader panoramic vision, literally seeing more of your environment \nall at once. You don't have to do what I'm doing, which is not blinking. You're welcome to \nblink. But it means deliberately dilating your gaze so that you can see yourself in the \nenvironment you're in. It creates a calming effect on the mind because it releases a \nparticular circuit in the brainstem that's associated with alertness, aka stress. Now, this is \nvery powerful. If you're running, for instance, and you're at max capacity or close to it, or \nyou're kind of hitting like 80, 90% of maximum on the bike and you dilate your gaze, \nwhat you'll find is the mind can relax while the body is in full output. And this relates to \nwork that in various communities, people are working with this in the sports community, \nmilitary community, et cetera. But it's a form, not really of stress inoculation, it's more \nabout raising stress threshold so that the body is going to continue to be in a high \nalertness, high reactivity mode, high output, but the mind is calm. And so, this isn't about \nunifying mind and body. This is actually about using body to bring up your level of \nactivation, then dissociating, not the clinical dissociation kind of disorders, but \ndissociating the mental or emotional response from what's going on in your body. And \nover time, so if you do this a couple of times, you don't have to do this every workout, but \nif you do this every maybe once a week or so, you start being comfortable at these \nhigher activation states. What once felt overwhelming and like a lot of work, now is \nmanageable. It feels tolerable. So, that's for navigating medium-term stress.

For many of you, it's 30 nights per month. For some of you, it's zero nights per \nmonth. And congratulations to you zero nights per month people. If you are managing \nyour sleep really well every night, that is fantastic. You really want to be able to fall \nasleep at night, stay asleep for most of the night.

Okay, so let's talk about long-term stress. Earlier, I talked about how \nbreathing can modulate heart rate through this loop that includes the brain and the \nparasympathetic nervous system. I don't think I mentioned this, and I want to make sure \nthat I mentioned that breathing controlling heart rate through the sympathetic and \nparasympathetic nervous system is the basis of what's called HRV, heart rate variability. \nAnd we know that heart rate variability is good. You don't want your heart rate \nchronically elevated or chronically low. A lot of people think, \"Oh, I want a really nice low \nheart rate.\" And indeed, if you're in shape, the stroke volume of your heart will be greater \nand you can have a nice slow heart rate. Years ago when I was running regularly, I think \nmy heart rate was down to like 50 or 60 or something like that. That's great. But, and \nnow it's higher than that because I'm running a little bit less. But everyone needs to \ndetermine what's right for them. But you don't really want your heart rate to be \nchronically low or chronically high. Both are bad. We know that chronic stress, elevated \nstress and especially in the so-called type A personalities creates heart disease, the \nleading killer of for in most, every country, but in particular in the US. Because of the way \nthat adrenaline impacts those blood vessels or constricting some and dilating others, it's \njust that kind of hypertension, chronic hypertension is just bad. And so, chronic stress \ntruly is bad. I want to really make that clear because I emphasized a lot of what some of \nthe positive effects of stress. But you want to be able to tamp down your stress in real \ntime.

And this is a particularly important issue nowadays where we have all these \nproxies or surrogates for social connection. We're online and texting with people a lot, so \nwe can feel connected. Like the plane's about to take off and everyone's texting each \nother whether or not they have fear of flying or not. They're like, \"Okay, see you. Love \nyou.

Also father and child, but especially mother and child, \nbecause its relationship to the lactation system. Couples post-sex. These kinds of things \nthat reflect deep kind of layers of our biology. And oxytocin is not just released when we \nwalk in and pat the dog on the head or we see somebody and we give them a hug and, \n\"Hi, great to see you,\" fist bump. That's not a situation for oxytocin.

Neuromodulators are a little bit like playlists in the brain. \nThey tend to amplify or bias the likelihood that certain brain circuits and body circuits are \ngoing to be activated and that others will not. Serotonin generally, and I realize I'm \nspeaking very generally here, but it generally gives us feelings of wellbeing. At very high \nlevels, it makes us feel blissed and it tends to make us feel like we have enough in our \nimmediate environment. This is why some of the side effects of antidepressants that \nelevate serotonin, and actually can help a lot of people with depressive symptoms. But \nthe side effects associated with drugs that increase serotonin tend to be reduced affect. \nThey tend to kind of blunt affect or make people feel like their libido is lower. Desire goes \ndown because the body has so much serotonin and the brain has so much serotonin, \nthat one feels like they have enough. But serotonin, pharmacology aside or taking \nantidepressants aside a topic for another time, serotonin tends to make us feel good. \nWhen we see somebody that we recognize and trust, serotonin is released in the brain. \nAnd that has certain positive effects on the immune system and on other systems of \nneural repair and synopsis and things that really reinforce connections in the brain and \nprevent that long-term withering of connections. So, serotonin is tied to social \nconnection. Now, social connection can take many forms. As many of you know, I am \nvery attached to my dog. I hope he's attached to me. He's asleep most of the time. So, I \ndon't know. And even if he was awake, I don't really know what I would ask him. But he \nseems more or less to be attached to me as well. And there's no scientific evidence that \nit has to be human-human attachment. I do have attachments to humans as well. But \nyou can have attachments to other people. Some of those can be romantic attachments. \nThey could be familial attachments that are non-romantic, friendship, pets, even \nattachments to things that just delight us. One of the things that really can mitigate \nagainst the long-term negative effects of chronic long-term stress isn't just having fun. \nWe hear all this stuff, \"You need to play and have fun.\" That can be a little bit of a tough \nconcept, especially for the hard driving people or people that are stressed, but having a \nsense of delight, a sense of really enjoying something that you see and engage in, \nwitness, or participate in, that is associated with the serotonin system. And certainly, \nplay is one of those things. Social connection of various forms. Those are things to \ninvest in.

It takes investment. It takes time in not needing everything \nto be exactly the way you want it to be. I have a friend who struggles with this and \noftentimes the conversations just circle back to the fact that when you want social \nconnection, you often have to be more flexible. You have to eat on other people's \nschedules. Sometimes you have to eat things you don't necessarily want to eat the most \nin that moment or stay up a little later or wake up a little earlier.

Taqi Kynan is a \nmolecule that makes us more fearful, paranoid, and impairs our immune system. And so, \nTaqi Kynan is like this internal punishment signal. It's like our body and our brain telling \nus, \"You're not spending enough time with people that you really trust. You're not \nspending time doing things that you really enjoy.\" And I often think about Taqi Kynan for \nmyself because I'm pretty hard driving. I have a lot of pursuits. I also have a lot of \nwonderful people and an incredibly wonderful bulldog in my life, but there are times \nwhen I can be so goal-directed and so in motion and trying to accomplish everything, \nthat I sometimes forget about Taqi Kynan.

Not emotional darkness. But light suppresses melatonin. Melatonin helps you fall \nasleep. It doesn't help you stay asleep. I personally do not recommend supplementing \nmelatonin because it's supplemented typically at very high levels. One to three \nmilligrams or even more that is an outrageously high dose. It's super, super physiological \ncompared to what you normally would make. It also has a number of potentially negative \neffects on the reproductive access and hormones there. Some people can take it without \nproblems. If you like it and that's your thing, fine. I just want to cue to the fact that there \ncan be issues. You should check on examine.com. Talk to your doctor, especially in \nkids, because melatonin suppresses the puberty response in a number of species. \nEnough about the negative things in melatonin except that people who take too much \nmelatonin chronically, oftentimes when they're taking it to sleep or for whatever reason, \nyes, it can reduce anxiety and stress, but it also can reduce the output of the adrenals", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2843, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c28330ae-6860-4a80-8965-abbb42689426": {"__data__": {"id_": "c28330ae-6860-4a80-8965-abbb42689426", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "de0dc8a2-b3e1-468d-94f6-8c9436d71459", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "967e8c949204005e630080a73aa1c63053eb9a7ce35614050aaa07cd47c29f89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com \n \n01:19:15 Adrenal Burnout Is A Myth\u2026 But Why You Need to Know About It Anyway  \n \nto the point where it can become problematic. Now, a note about adrenal burnout. There \nis actually no such thing as adrenal burnout under normal conditions. The adrenals have \nenough adrenaline to support 200 years of stress for better, for worse. The concept of \nadrenal burnout has origins in the work of Nobel Prize winner, Hans Selye, who actually \ndiscovered what he called the general adaptation syndrome. He discovered a lot of \nthings about stress. He did some phenomenal work that turned out to be true. That we \nhave stressors. There's something called distress. He talked about eustress, which is \npositive stress. Eustress has never really caught on in the kind of more general \ndiscussion. But he had this theory that if stress went on long enough, that you would \neventually reach a phase called exhaustion. And that turned out to be wrong. Although \nmany of you may feel exhausted after chronic stress, there isn't really a physiological \nexhaustion that happens. And that eventually got picked up and ran with the general \npublic. And they talk about adrenal burnout. Too much coffee, adrenal burnout. You hear \nall this stuff. There is no such thing as adrenal burnout. The adrenals don't burn out. \nThere is something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, which is a real \nphysiological problem where some people have very impaired adrenals and they can't \nproduce adrenaline. And melatonin taken at very high levels for periods of time that are \ntoo long can cause suppression of the cortisol and epinephrine released from the \nadrenals and can create a kind of pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, be aware \nof melatonin for that reason. Please, I'm trying, I alone can't get rid of the phrase adrenal \nburnout. I'm not trying to give a hard time to anyone who feels burnt out or exhausted, \nbut it is for other reasons. It is not because of the adrenals are burnt out. Unless you \nhappen to have adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, I'm not a fan of melatonin for a lot of \nreasons. Now I've mentioned several.  \n \n01:21:10 L-Theanine For Stress Reduction and Task Completion Anxiety  \n \nThe other is L-theanine.

It was very important that we discuss \nstress and we discuss in the context of short, medium, and long-term stress. That we \ndiscuss tools for short-term, medium-term, and long-term control. I don't really want to \nsay mitigation of stress. Stress is going to happen. But our ability to modulate and \ncontrol stress in real time offline using tools such as respiration, using tools such as \ndilation of gaze, using tools like social connection, maybe some supplements, certainly \ntake care of your sleep and nutrition and exercise. Again, tons of resources and \ninformation in the sleep episodes. So, you can look there. We will do a month on \nhormones, on exercise, et cetera. But let's talk about emotions because in subsequent \nepisodes, we're going to talk about OCD, we're going to talk about depression, we're \ngoing to talk about mania, we're going to be talking about dopamine and all sorts of \nthings. But at the core of emotions is this question, what is an emotion? Well, it's \ncomplex. There isn't a single brain area for any one of these things that we call \nemotions. My framework, and I think the modern science, both psychology and \nneuroscience is pretty well-aligned with what Lisa Feldman Barrett has taught about. \nNow, Lisa's at Northeastern University. She runs a big lab there. She's a world expert in \nemotion. She's written two books that are really wonderful. One is \"How Emotions Are \nMade,\" which was her first book. The second one is \"Seven and a Half Facts About the \nBrain.\" It's a wonderful book as well. It came out more recently. I hosted Lisa on an \nInstagram live once. Maybe we'll get her here on the podcast if we're lucky. We don't \nagree on everything about the neuroscience of emotions, but I subscribed to most \neverything that I've heard Lisa say. In particular, the fact that emotions are context-\ndependent. There's a cultural dependence, et cetera. I look at things mainly through the \nlens of physiology and neuroscience and kind of low-level circuitry. And one way to think \nabout emotions that I think is consistent and I think Lisa would generally approve, I can't \nspeak for her, but I would hope she would generally approve of this description, is that", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2715, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9faa3a0f-f1cb-4131-8be3-db0b708d127c": {"__data__": {"id_": "9faa3a0f-f1cb-4131-8be3-db0b708d127c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fd216135-6a44-451f-8237-4b91ae9cccc8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "b725266f0da504bfc10dca646818b4e715dd9e7990ca8ea17e0d4659899979b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com \nwhen our internal state of stress or calm matches the demands on us or is mismatched \nfrom the demands on us, we tend to interpret those as good or bad. Let me give you an \nexample. If I am feeling very anxious, very stressed inside, and I have a lot to do, that \ndoesn't feel good, but it's really no different than if I'm very tired and I have a lot to do \nbecause there's this mismatch. I'm not in the right internal state, my internal state is \nincorrect rather, to meet the demands that are being placed upon me. So, in both cases, \nwhether I'm too tired or I'm too stressed to do what I need to do, the valence, meaning \nthe value that I assigned to that is I don't feel good. It's not a good situation and I don't \nfeel good. Now, I might call it stressed, I might call it anxious, I might call it worried, I \nmight call it a number of things, but it's not good. However, when I'm tired and I want to \nfall asleep, well then I feel good because that's what the demand is. I need to go to sleep \nand I'm tired. If I'm wide awake and I need to fall asleep, then that's not good. And then \nthe brain tends to go down the direction of interpreting the situation as a bad one. So, \nwhile the discussion around emotions is far more nuanced and more elaborate than this, \none way to think about your relationship to emotions is whether or not your internal state \nis matching the demands that are upon you. So, in that way, we don't really place so \nmuch value on whether or not we're feeling alert or sleepy. We only place value on \nwhether or not that alertness whether or not it's full-blown stress or not or our sleepiness, \nwhether or not we're falling asleep or just a little bit drowsy, whether or not that matches \nthe conditions that we face. And it's a useful framework to have. And it's the reason in \npart why I spent this last hour and a half or so talking about stress and how to control \nstress. One reason we did that is because I think it's a valuable opportunity to learn \nsome tools and understand stress and really learn how to take control of stress, which I \nthink we could all benefit from doing regardless of age. The other reason is that when \nyou start to understand that you have this kind of see-saw system in your body, this \nautonomic nervous system that takes you from alert and calm to stressed to full-blown \npanic, it has that capacity, or from sleepy and drowsy to passing out tired to God forbid, \nlet's hope never, but a coma, right? That you're basically on this see-saw all the time. \nAnd where you are on that see-saw of alertness or calmness positions you to be in \nbetter reaction to the demands that you face. Whether or not the thing that you face is a \nneed to fall asleep or to listen quietly and not react. You now know, for instance, that if \nyour job is to take feedback, when maybe you're going in for a job evaluation or you're in \na relationship where there was a call for a discussion and somebody needs to talk to you \nabout something and we need to talk about something, you're going to there you're like,", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3096, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4ad576e-f1f2-4d4b-85af-dc3f314c822f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4ad576e-f1f2-4d4b-85af-dc3f314c822f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f46fd07d-38c6-4792-9e59-194011d95010", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "be95ed150f1a77a77d0956baeab076511926e8ab587ba15ef65d21169166ca85", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com \n\"Goodness, this is going to be rough.\" Learning to reduce that stress response a little bit \nso that you are in a position to hear the information better, and remember, from a \nprevious episode, if you close your eyes, you'll be able to actually focus on the \ninformation better.

You will be able to react to things in a more effective way and to \nnot be reactive. And this is really one of the important things to me anyway, is that so \nmuch of the language around psychology, which I think is a wonderful field, but pop \npsychology in particular is be responsive, not reactive. Well, great. But then how does \none do that? Well, one does that by modulating their short-term stress response in real \ntime. Not by saying, \"Hold on, I need to meditate. Hold on, I need a massage and then I \ncan have this conversation.\" By modulating the reactivity in real time. How does one, for \ninstance, be mindful? Which is a beautiful concept, but how are you mindful? Well, I \ndon't know, when I'm moving through my day, a lot of times I'm just trying to get things \ndone. And as soon as I start monitoring and seeing what I'm doing and kind of third-\npersoning what I'm doing, it actually takes me out of the effectiveness and experience of \nwhat I'm doing. So for me, sometimes that mindfulness, that observer, as they call it, is \nsomething that doesn't help me. It actually hinders me. What's important to me is to be \nable to work and focus and then to be able to disengage. To be able to do a non-sleep \ndepressed or to be able to still fall asleep even though I've been working hard until 9:30 \nto put my head down at 10 o'clock and be out cold sleeping by 10:02. That's possible if \nyou can learn to control this stress response. And to do that, we can't use the mind to \ncontrol. The mind, we need tools. And so, a lot of the people being grumpy or anxious or \ndepressed, a lot of that, provided it's not for some underlying neurochemical reason \nthat's chronic, a lot of that come from being poorly rested, from overworked, from feeling \nlike the world is bearing down on us. And so, rather than take a subjective view of this, I \ntake the view of objective physiology. What can we do that's anchored to these neuronal \nsystems in our body, in our brain, in our eyes, in our diaphragm, et cetera, and look to \nthose as tools leavers that we can pull on and push and maneuver through life in a way \nwhere we start to feel like we have some agency.

So, I think that ought to set the stage \nfor where we're headed next, which is to talk about all the things that you normally think \nof when you think of emotions, like happiness, like awe, like joy. And we will get into \nsome of that. But all of that rests firmly on the foundation of this thing we call the \nautonomic nervous system. This stress modulation. This calming modulation system. \nAnd again, whether or not you're activated or you're calm is not good or bad, it depends \non the situation. Certainly, when you want to fall asleep, being activated isn't good. \nWhen you have work to do, being activated is great.
