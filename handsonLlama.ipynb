Slow wave sleep, which occurs primarily in the early part of the night, is important for motor learning and the acquisition of detailed information. During slow wave sleep, the brain undergoes processes that strengthen neural connections related to the learned information, leading to improved retention and recall. Additionally, REM sleep, which occurs throughout the night with a higher percentage towards morning, is associated with emotional processing and memory consolidation. Overall, both slow wave sleep and REM sleep contribute to the enhancement of learning and memory by facilitating the storage and organization of newly acquired information in the brain.\n"
