This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise. I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay? So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine. Turns out the definition of insomnia is when you're experiencing excessive sleepiness during the day. Sleepiness and fatigue are different, okay? So in the world of sleep medicine fatigue is a physical exhaustion, sleepiness is falling asleep. Like falling asleep at your desk or falling asleep during lectures, or there seems to be something special about my lectures that makes people want to fall asleep. So if this cures your insomnia fantastic, however, in all seriousness, sleepiness during the day time unless it's around your temperature peak and only lasts about 90 minutes or so, is a sign of insomnia. It's a sign of lack of sleep. I want to be very, very clear that if you know your temperature minimum, you can shift your clock using light. You can also shift your clock by engaging in exercise in the four hours after your temperature minimum to wake up earlier on subsequent nights, or exercise before then to delay your clock, okay? So now you can start to see and understand the logic of the system. And we'll talk about why this works and the underlying biology, but understanding that temperature is the effector and understanding that you have this low point that reflects your most sleepy point, essentially right before waking up, and then temperature rises, you can now start to shift that temperature according to your travel needs. Here's one way in which you might do that. Let's say I am going to travel to Europe, which is nine hours ahead typically, from California. I would want to determine my temperature minimum which for me is about 4:30 AM maybe 5:00 AM, and I would want to start getting up at about 5:30 AM and getting some bright light exposure, presumably from artificial sources because the sunlight isn't going to be out at that time. Maybe even exercising as well, maybe even eating a meal at that time if that's in your practice. You would want to start doing that two or three days before travel. Because, once you land in or I land in Europe, chances are just viewing the sunrise or sunset in Europe is not going to allow me to shift my circadian clock. Some people say get sunlight in your eyes when you land but that's not going to work because one of two things is likely to happen. With a nine hour shift like that either I'm going to view sunlight at a time that corresponds to the circadian dead zone, the time in which my circadian clock can't be shifted, or I'm going to end up viewing sunlight at a time that corresponds to the four to six hour window before my temperature minimum. So it's going to shift me in exactly the opposite direction that I want to go. So it can be very, very challenging for people to adjust to jet lag. So you need to ask, am I traveling east or am I traveling west? Am I trying to advance my clock or delay my clock? Remember viewing light, exercise and eating in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum will delay your clock. Eating, viewing sunlight, and exercising, you don't have to do all three but some combination of those in the four to six hours after your temperature minimum will advance your clock. And this is a powerful mechanism by which you can shift your clock anywhere from one to three hours per day, which is remarkable. That means your temperature minimum is going to shift out as much as three hours, which can make it such that you can travel all the way to Europe and in as long as you've prepared for a day or so by doing what I described back home and then doing it when you arrive, you can potentially accomplish the entire shift within anywhere from 24 to 36 hours. And this is really important to emphasize that once you arrive in your new location and here I'm talking about traveling eastward, California to Europe, once you arrive in your new location, you have to keep track of what your temperature minimum was back home and how it's being shifted during your trip. Now it's much easier to do than you think. One of the unfortunate consequences of the smartphone is that you can't do something goofy like wearing two watches. One watch that corresponds to the time back home and another one that corresponds to the local time. Typically it updates automatically based on wifi, etc. But if you can keep track of the time back home then you can easily shift your clock going forward. I'm hoping this will makes sense. I really want to emphasize that you don't have to be precise down to the minute. Some of you may be asking, well, what about you've got this temperature minimum and if I view light one minute before it then I'm going to delay my clock and one minute after it I'm going to advance my clock. It doesn't quite work like that, okay. But it's very important to understand that light is the primary way in which we can shift our clock. And now you should also be able to understand things like the circadian dead zone from about 9:30, 10:00 AM all the way until six hours before your temperature minimum. You're not going to shift your clock. Nothing that you do in that time in terms of light viewing behavior, feeding, etc, is going to shift your clock. And so a lot of people are landing in Europe getting sunlight in their eyes and throwing their clock out of whack or not shifting their clock at all. This brings me to the other thing that's highly recommended. And I've mentioned this before, but you want to eat on the local meal schedule. If it's in your practice to fast, fast, that's fine. But when you eat, you want to eat within the local schedule for alertness. Okay. That means if you arrive and everyone's eating breakfast and you can't stomach the idea of breakfast in your new location 'cause your appetite isn't there. That means the clock in your liver, you have a clock in your liver, biological clock, has not caught up to the new time zone. You can force yourself to eat if you like, or you can skip that meal. But what you don't want to do is stay on your home meal schedule, waking up in the middle of the night and eating. That is really going to throw things off because a lot of the clocks in the periphery like from the liver, the peripheral body, will send information back to the brain and then the brain is getting really conflicted signals. So the temperature minimum is really your anchor point for shifting your clock best. I don't know why this information really hasn't made it into the popular sphere, quite so much. There's all sorts of stuff about taking things like melatonin, using binaural beats, a lot of kind of like more sophisticated, complicated, and potentially problematic ways of trying to shift the clock. Let's talk about melatonin but first I just want to pause and shift gears a little bit because I talked about traveling eastward, but we haven't talked about traveling westward. So I want to do that now. Let's say you're raveling from New York to California or from Europe to California. The challenge there tends to be, how can you stay up late enough? Now, some people are able to do this because as I mentioned earlier, the autonomic nervous system is asymmetrically wired such that it's easier to stay up late later than we would naturally want to than it is to go to sleep earlier. So let's say you land and it's 4:00 PM and you're just dying, you're in California, you came from Europe, it's 4:00 PM and you really, really want to go to sleep. That's where the use of things like caffeine, exercise, and sunlight can shift you, right? If it's after your temperature peak then viewing sunlight around 6:00 PM or 8:00 PM or artificial light, if there isn't sunlight, will help shift you later, right? It's going to delay your clock and you're going to be able to stay up later. The worst thing you can do is take a nap that was intended to last 20 minutes or an hour. I do this routinely and then wake up four hours later or you wake up and it's midnight and you can't fall back asleep. You really want to avoid doing that. So provided it's not excessive amounts, stimulants like caffeine and coffee or tea can really help you push past that afternoon barrier and get you to sleep more like on the local schedule. And eating on the local schedule as well. A number of people have asked about the use of melatonin to induce sleepiness. All right, well let's think about what melatonin is. Melatonin is this hormone that's released from the pineal gland, which is this gland. A couple of notes about the pineal, 'cause I've been getting a lot of questions about this. I'm probably going to draw some fire for this but I'd be happy to have a thoughtful, considerate debate, with some peer reviewed papers in front of us. The pineal does make this hallucinogenic molecule they call DMT, but in such a minuscule amounts that it is not responsible for the hallucinations you see in sleep and dreaming. Sorry, folks. It's also not responsible for the hallucinations you might see through other approaches to DMT. It's just not, that's not where the DMT comes from. It's infinitesimally small amounts. There are a lot of kind of wacky claims out there about calcification of the pineal and fluoride and this kind of thing. Look, the pineal sits in an area of the brain near the fourth ventricle, where the skull is not terribly far away although there's some overlap in neural tissue and with age there's some aggregation of some of the meninges and other things around there that stick to the skull. Young brains don't look like old brains but there's no calcification of the pineal, all right? So you can forget about calcification of the pineal as a problem. I don't know where that whole thing got started but that's not an issue. Your pineal will churn out melatonin your whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin during development is also responsible for timing the secretion of certain hormones that are vitally important for puberty. Does melatonin control the onset of puberty? Not directly, but indirectly. Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which is a hormone that's released from your hypothalamus also roughly above the roof of your mouth in your brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone is really interesting 'cause it stimulates the release of another hormone called luteinizing hormone, which in females causes estrogen to be released within the ovaries, it's involved in reproductive cycles, and in males stimulates testosterone from the sertoli cells of the testes. Melatonin is inhibitory to GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and therefore is inhibitory to LH, luteinizing hormone, and therefore is inhibitory to testosterone and estrogen. There's just no two ways about it. There is immense amount of data on the fact that high levels of melatonin in seasonally breeding animals, takes the ovaries from nice and robust ovaries that are capable of deploying eggs and this kind of thing and literally shrinking them and making these animals infertile. These are very high levels of melatonin in seasonal breeders in winter. Melatonin in males of seasonal breeders takes the testes and shrinks them. Long ago when I was at UC, Berkeley as a master's student, I was working on neuroendocrinology, and we were working on this hamster species of seasonal breeders. And basically when days are long, which inhibits melatonin, these little Siberian hamsters as they're called, have testes about the size of, sort of typical table grapes, although that's a weird way to put it. When days get shorter and the melatonin signal gets longer because light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin gets longer. Those same hamsters would have testes that would involute to the size of about a grain of rice. Now this does not happen in humans in short days. But nonetheless, the melatonin signal really does have a ton of effects on the hormone system. Now, does that mean that if you've been taking melatonin you've really screwed up your hormones? Not necessarily. Does it mean if a kid has been taking melatonin that's really screwing up their puberty? Not necessarily and here's why. Melatonin operates on a concentration level. So in a child that's very, very small that has high levels of melatonin, it actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone or estrogen depending on the sex of the child. But as that child grows through other mechanisms, like growth hormone release, etc, that same amount of melatonin released from the pineal is now diluted over a much larger body so that the concentration actually goes way, way down, okay? But here's the problem with supplementing melatonin. As I mentioned in the previous episode, concentrations of melatonin in many commercial supplements have been shown to be anywhere from 85% to 400% of what's listed on the bottle. So when you take melatonin or a child takes melatonin oftentimes they are taking super physiological levels of melatonin, which at least by my read, and the literature, says that it could have dramatic effects on timing and course of things like puberty. So it's not so much that the journals have come out saying, oh, taking that melatonin inhibits puberty, it's that no single study has been done with the super physiological levels of melatonin that are present in a lot of these supplements in developing children. So melatonin is used widely for inducing sleepiness when you want to fall asleep in the new location that you've arrived, right? You can't fall asleep, you take melatonin, it helps you fall asleep. It does not help you stay asleep. In addition to that, melatonin has been kind of touted as the best way to shift your circadian clock. I'm happy to go on record saying, look, if you need melatonin, you can work with a doctor or somebody who really understands circadian and sleep biology go for it, if that's your thing. But I, as always on this podcast and elsewhere, I have a bias toward behavioral things that you can titrate and control like exposure to light exercise, temperature, etc, that have much bigger margins for safety and certainly don't have these other endocrine effects that we've been thinking about and talking about. So if you want to take melatonin in the afternoon in order to fall asleep or in the evening, be my guest, that's up to you. Again, you're responsible for your health, not me. But for many people melatonin is not going to be the best solution. The best solution is going to be to use light and temperature, and exercise on either side of the temperature minimum to shift your clock both before your trip and when you land in your new location and your clock starts to shift. Okay, so now you know my opinions about melatonin, feel free to filter them through your own opinions and experiences with melatonin. And now you also understand what your temperature minimum is and how it represents an important landmark either side of which you can use light, temperature, and exercise to shift your clock. Just to remind you a little bit about temperature, if you want to shift your clock, typically you would do that by you can take a hot shower and then that will have a cooling effect after the hot shower. And if you were to get into a cold shower or an ice bath if you have access to one, afterward there's going to be a thermogenic effect of your body increasing temperature. And if you just think about your natural rhythm back home when everything's stable, you have an idea a low point in which is your temperature minimum, and then you have a peak, and you think about when you're doing this hot or cold shower in that rhythm, now you should be able to understand how you're shifting your rhythm. That temperature rhythm is the one that's going to move. Give you an example. If I were to wake up in the morning and let's say I wake up at 6:00 AM. My temperature I know is rising, I've passed my temperature minimum. If I were to get into a hot shower, that would then lower my body temperature when I got out, that is not normally what's happening first thing in the morning, and therefore my clock would very likely get phase delayed, right? It's going to delay the increase in temperature. Whereas if I got into a cold shower, something I don't personally like to do, but I've done from time to time or an ice bath that's going to then have a rebound increase in body temperature and is going to phase advance my clock. That peak in the afternoon is going to come about an hour earlier. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier, later that night. So you can start to play these games with timing and hot and cold, with meals whether or not you eat, or you don't eat, and with light exposure, whether or not you view light or you don't view light. So now you can start to see why understanding the core mechanics of a system can really give you the most flexibility because I could spend the next 25 years of my life answering every question about every nuance pattern of travel. Well, we're going to Sydney and then we're going there, what should I do? But that's on you. You need to figure out your temperature minimum and your temperature peak, if you like, and then use these parameters to it gives you flexibility. And that really underscores the most important thing is that when you understand mechanism it's not about being neurotically attached to a specific protocol, it's the opposite. It gives you power to not be neurotically attached to a specific protocol. It can give you great confidence and flexibility in being able to shift your body rhythms however you want. And when things get out of whack you can tuck them right back into place. One thing that's common is that people need to do a quick trip. It's not always that you're going to go to, you know on vacation for two weeks or, you know, work someplace else for weeks on end. If your trip is 48 hours or less, stay on your home schedule. This can be tough and it may require scheduling meetings according to your home schedule, but if you can somehow manage that the best thing to do would be to stay on your home schedule. Your clock is not going to shift more than a couple hours, even if you do everything correctly in one day, okay? So if I were to travel, say to Europe, I've actually done this, I did a 24 hour trip to Basel, Switzerland, gave a talk and came back, people thought I was crazy but, I had a little bit of travel fatigue 'cause remember there's fatigue from the actual travel experience. The novelty of it, the air is never great on the planes, this was even true before there were mask requirements and things like that. There's the travel fatigue but you don't throw your clock off. If you stay 48 hours, then you start to shift a little bit. 72, that's when you start running into trouble. The transit time is also important but I would say if it's three days or less, stay on your home schedule as much as you can. And because sunlight isn't under your control unless there's something about you I don't know, that's when traveling with some sort of bright light like the light pad that I have down there that I showed earlier, for those of you listening just on audio, it sort of looks like an eight and a half by 11 inch pad. It's actually not designed for wake up, it's actually designed, it's a drawing pad, and it emits about 1,000 lux of light. And so if you want to travel with something like that, you can use that in your hotel room to wake up when you like. Some people will use night shades, you know, not the night shades that you eat or that some people say you're not supposed to eat, I don't know anything about that, but the eye covers to keep light out. Those can be very useful on planes and in hotels and so on. So you can use light and dark or you can travel with your light and dark devices so that you can stay on your home schedule and get most of your light when it would be your normal wake up time back home. And what's kind of nice is if you know when your circadian dead zone is back home, which is generally for most people around 10:00 AM to about 3:00 PM, so basically the rising phase of your temperature, then you can also feel free to be outside without having to wear sunglasses or you don't have to worry about light exposure. But if you know that window before your temperature minimum, that four to six hour window, that's the time when if you're viewing a lot of light in your new location, you are going to shift your clock pretty considerably and then you can come back home and have a terrible time. At the end of graduate school, I went to Australia, remarkable country, incredible people, incredible wildlife, had amazing time, I came back and it was the first time in my life where I couldn't sleep on a regular schedule. I was sleeping in like hour long increments throughout the day, it was a nightmare. And it took me weeks to get back on target. And the way I was able to do that was exercising consistently at the same time every 24 hours, turning my home into essentially a cave at night, even covering up the windows and then getting as much bright light in my eyes as I possibly could during the day, no sunglasses, etc. So it can take some real work if your clock gets thrown out of whack. There's a phenomenon called ICU psychosis, where people that are in the intensive care unit in hospitals actually lose their mind. They become psychotic, hallucinations, etc. And it's because of altered circadian cycles. We know this 'cause they're exposed to these lights and these sounds, people coming in and checking on them. They leave the hospital or in some cases, there have been experiments where people are placed near a window where they get some natural light and the psychotic symptoms disappear, presuming there weren't psychotic symptoms beforehand, before they entered the hospital. So it's pretty dramatic what light can do to the psyche and to the body. So let's talk a little bit about a different form of jet lag that requires no planes, no trains, no automobiles, and that's shift work. Shift work is becoming increasingly common. Many of us are shift working even though we don't have to. We're doing work in the middle of the night, we are, you know, working on our computers at odd hours, sleeping during the day. A lot of people who are under shelter and place type stuff, are doing more of this. Kids with the drifting school schedules. Here's the deal with shift work. If there's one rule of thumb for shift work, it's that if at all possible, you want to stay on the same schedule for at least 14 days, including weekends. Now that should immediately cue the non shift workers to the importance of not getting too far off track on the weekend, even if you're not a shift worker. So sleeping in on Sunday is not a good idea. The most important thing about shift work is to stay consistent with your schedule. Now, I had a conversation on an Instagram live with Samer Hattar, who's a neuroscientist at the National Institutes of Mental Health, he's actually the head of the chronobiology unit there. And he was really emphasizing this point because shift work where people are doing the so-called swing shift, where they're working four days on one shift and four days on or another, is extremely detrimental to a number of health parameters. It gets the cortisol release from the adrenals really out of whack. And there're these cortisol spikes at various hours of the day, it messes up learning, it really disrupts the dopamine system and wellbeing. It is a serious, serious problem. So if you can negotiate with your employer to stay on the same shift for two weeks at a time, that's going to be immensely beneficial and will help you offset a lot of the negative effects of shift work. Now, I don't presume that all of you are going to be able to do that. Some of you just don't have that level of control. And of course, I want to acknowledge that shift workers are essential, right? Of course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, but also pilots, night nurses, people working on the hospital wards, people picking up trash. These night shifts are critical to our functioning as a society, as I'm sure all of you can appreciate. If you're going to work a shift where let's say, you start at 4:00 PM and you end at 2:00 AM, excuse me, then there's some important questions that arise. For instance, should you see light during your shift? Well, this is a matter of personal choice but ideally you want to view as much light as possible and as is safely possible when you need to be alert. So that would mean from 4:00 PM to 2:00 AM and then you would want to sleep. So using light as a correlate of alertness and using darkness as a correlate of sleepiness, what this means is see as much light as you safely can during the phase of your day when you want to be awake. So it's the same thing I said way back at the beginning of this podcast episode. And see as little light as safely possible and it allows you to function during the time when you want to be asleep. So if you're finishing out that 2:00 AM shift, that's when you would want to avoid bright light exposure, you'd want to go home, you'd really want to avoid watching TV if possible. If you need that in order to fall asleep, that would be a case where something like dimming the screen, plus blue blockers, if that's in your practice or you want to do that would be helpful and then going to sleep and then you'll probably wake up late in the afternoon or early afternoon. Some of you might say, wait, Huberman, I thought you don't like blue blockers. I never said I don't like blue blockers. I don't like people wearing blue blockers at the time of day when they want to be alert. And I don't like people asserting that blue blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply because people are wearing them. The brightness of light is what's important it's not about the blue. So if you want to wear them, wear them, or just dim the lights or turn the lights off. So let's say you go to sleep at, you get home after this 4:00 PM to 2:00 AM shift, you maybe eat something, you go to sleep, and you wake up and it's noon or 1:00 PM. Should you get light in your eyes? Well, your first assumption based on what I've said previously might be that you're in the circadian dead zone that you can't because it's noon 1:00 PM. But you're not in the circadian dead zone because you're somebody who goes to sleep early in the morning at 2:00 AM. So it's not like the circadian dead zone is a strict time of day, it's an internal biological clock. So what do you need to know? You guessed it, you need to know your temperature minimum. You need to know whether not your temperature is increasing or decreasing. And now we can make this whole thing even simpler and just say, if your temperature is decreasing, avoid light. If your temperature is increasing, get light. It's that simple, okay? If your temperature is decreasing, avoid light, if your temperature is increasing, get light. The shift worker who works from 4:00 PM until 2:00 AM has a temperature rhythm that's very different than mine where I wake up around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, and I go to sleep around 11:00 PM, okay? We both have a 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine is more aligned to the rise and setting of the sun and there's is not, right? So you have to know your internal temperature rhythm. And no you don't have to walk around with a thermometer wherever, taking your temperature. Although it'd be great if some of the devices that are out there, you know, people are counting their steps, I think it'd be great if people had a circadian body temperature measurement. I'm not involved in any of this device development but I think it's a real call to arms, pun intended, to have a wristband that would measure temperature and would tell you your temperature minimum when you travel or whatnot. I don't know, maybe some of these devices already do that. But if they don't, they should. It's absolutely absurd to me why we wouldn't have the simple measurement, very easy to get that kind of information. You don't even need the exact temperature read all you need to know is the high and low point. So let's say you're a shift worker who really is nocturnal, you're flipped. Well, you want to stay on that nocturnal schedule. Now that can be very hard on families and social life of all kinds. But the person who is working say from, you know, 8:00 PM, like sundown to sunrise, this raises a question. Should they be looking at the sunrise and should they be watching the sunset? Waking up with a sunset, going asleep at the sunrise. You think, well, is that light going to throw them off? Ah, probably not. It's just actually going to invert what sunrise and sunset are. When they're waking up in the morning, if they look at the, you know, they get some sunlight in their eyes, they look at the sun and get some bright light from devices or overhead lights in their apartment or home, well, that's going to tend to wake them up if it's in the evening, right? So it's, you know I don't know if I stated that clearly, but if in the evening the sun is setting and they're looking at that setting sun, that is the morning sun for that person and it will wake them up for their night shift. So temperature rising. Then toward morning, what's happening? Okay, well, they're closing out their work shift. You're going home, the sun is rising. Do you look at the rising sun? Well, based on what you now know your eyes are very sensitive to resetting of circadian clocks. What will it do at that time? If this were a classroom, I would either cold call on somebody or I'd wait for the oh, oh, oh, oh person in the audience that inevitably exists. So temperature is for that person, they've been up for a while, temperature is falling, not rising. For me it will be rising. But 'cause I'm diurnal, I'm awake during the day. For that person the temperature's falling and so they view light while temperature is falling. What's it going to do? It's going to phase delay them. It's going to make it harder for them to get to sleep the following night. So you would say that person should watch the setting sun to help them wake up 'cause they're going to work the night shift, but should probably have sunglasses on or avoid viewing bright light before they go to sleep. So it's the same thing. They're just on an inverted as a typical person who's diurnal, but they're on an inverted schedule. And so I'm really trying hard here to make this all really clear. There are kind of two patterns of requests in the world I'm noticing as I've kind of ventured into the this landscape of social media and podcasts. There are people who want to know every detail and want to quantify everything 'cause they want to get exactly right. These are like the graduate students and students that don't want to make a mistake. And to quote my graduate advisor, provided the mistakes are not dangerous, certainly not lethal, you kind of want to make a few little mistakes so that you can adjust, right? You don't want to endanger yourself. But it's actually, you're not going to get things perfect, that's called learning. Learning is when you realize, ah, I viewed the sun this time and then I stayed up and it really messed me up, I'll never do that again. The other category of people seem to want the one size fits all kind of like give me this pill or give me this protocol. And those things generally work but they don't afford people flexibility. And if there's anything like that, it's this temperature minimum thing that I've been just hammering on again and again and again today because it's something that you own and that you can really use as a key landmark for shifting your clock. I suppose there's a third category, which is, people accept that biological systems are actually much more forgiving than the way they're sometimes described. And I'm going to use this as an opportunity to editorialize a little bit. You know, there's so much made of sleep debt. Look there isn't an IRS equivalent for sleep. They're not going to come around and try and collect all the sleep that you didn't get. No one really knows what the consequences are going to be for you and for me and for the next person for the sleep you didn't get. You can't really recover the sleep you missed out on, but you also don't want to get neurotically attached to a schedule because there's this thing called sleep anxiety and then people have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. So I want to spend a moment on that and go back to a theme that I've said many times before, because these tools work what I called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. So this would be hypnosis, I gave you the link, but I'll say it again, reveriehealth.com for clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis for anxiety but also for sleep. Those are very beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols for things like yoga nidra, I provided some links to those in the caption for episode two. These things really work. Last night, I woke up, I went to bed about 10:30, I woke up at three in the morning, I knew I wasn't feeling rested. I did a NSDR protocol, I fell back asleep, I woke up at 6:30, okay. You need to teach your brain and your nervous system how to turn off your thoughts and go to sleep. And ideally you do that without medication unless there's a real need, you do that through these behavioral protocols. They work because they involve using the body to shift the mind not trying to just turn off your thoughts in the middle of the night. Now there are periods of life where things are stressful and people are concerned and you will have some struggle getting and staying asleep. And there's, that really has to do more with anxiety which NSDR protocols also can help with. As I always say, do them in the middle of the night if you wake up and you want to go back to sleep during the middle of the day, to teach your nervous system to calm down and do them first thing in the morning if you didn't feel you got enough sleep. In other words, do them whenever you have an opportunity to do them because they really can help you learn how to turn on the parasympathetic/calming arm of your autonomic nervous system. There's no other way that I'm aware of to teach your system to slow down and turn off your thoughts and go back to sleep. But these are powerful protocols, and there's a lot of research now to support the fact that they can really help. Meditation would be another example. Certain kinds of meditation involve focus and alertness. Those are slightly different than meditations that involve lack of focus and attention to say internal states. I'm going to pause there, and then I want to talk about kids and the elderly. In other words, how do we control sleep and circadian rhythms and wakefulness in babies, adolescents, teens, and aged folks. All right, before we talk about sleep in kids, I want to tell a little story. It's not a joke, many of you will be relieved that I'm not going to try and tell another joke this episode. Which is the relationship between light, skin and pelage color, dopamine and reproduction, mating. So many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters which I mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, other animals, change their color of their coat. In the winter they tend to be a lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes with flecks of black or brown. And in the summer their pelage changes to a color of you know, brown or red, some other vastly different color. That shift is controlled by light and by melatonin. This has an interesting correlate in humans. So humans obviously have different skin tones just genetically because of the amount of melanin in one skin, depending on genetic background. But of course sunlight will increase the amount of melanin in the skin regardless, right? This is suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. The whole system is wired so that shifts in skin color and shifts in these cells within the eye and melatonin are actually very closely linked. So here's the story. Many years ago, meaning about 10 years ago, 15 years ago, let's see it was 20 years ago, forgive me. A guy named Iggy Provencio who was running his own lab at uniformed armed services, this is a standard biological laboratory, discovered that there was an opsin in the eye in the cells of the eye that connect to the rest of the brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin, as many of you now know is the opsin, it's like a pigment, it absorbs light. It is the opsin that converts light into electrical signals to then set the circadian clock. Iggy discovered melanopsin because it was similar in form to what was in frog melanophores. It was actually in the skin of frogs that allowed those frogs to go from pale white, when it was dark, for most of the 24 hour cycle, to pigmented green or brown for a frog. So there's this relationship between the cells in our eye and the pigment cells of our skin. And we also know that in long days, there's more breeding. How does that work? Well that's actually from dopamine triggering increases in testosterone, mainly in males, and estrogen mainly in females although of course, there's testosterone estrogen in both sexes. So we have this kind of pathway where it's light, increases in the melanin, dopamine and reproduction on the one hand and lack of light, melatonin, decreases in the darkness of skin, less melanin in the skin, or in the case of an animal with fur, white fur and no reproduction on the other hand. And humans don't actually shift their breeding patterns tremendously from long days and short days, although there are some data that there's some shifts. We also don't radically change our skin color depending on how much sunlight exposure we have. But the simple way to put this is, when days are long, there's a lot more dopamine and we feel really good and there's a lot more breeding and breeding-like behavior. When days are short, there's a lot less dopamine and a lot less breeding behavior because these pathways are very highly conserved. Now what's interesting is that, as we've moved into a modern society where much of our waking days we are looking at screens, which is fine, 'cause we're getting a lot of light that way although not as much as sunlight. But also at night, we're getting a lot of light from screens. What's happened is all these path ways, melanin in the skin, turnover of skin cells, dopamine, all of this stuff has become completely disrupted. Now that's not to say that we should go back to a time in which we didn't use artificial lights. But I think the important thing to realize is that feeling good with getting a lot of light, the relationship to dopamine and melanin in the skin, and the good feelings of getting light also on our skin provided you're not getting burned or you're not getting excessive UV exposure, those are not just coincidences. Those are hard-wired biological mechanisms that exist in everybody regardless of how light or dark your skin is to begin with. There's another point, which is important, which is that the dopamine system which is this feel-good molecule is very closely related to the testosterone and estrogen in reproductive cycles. Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone, and the production of these hormones, and melatonin is the effector. It is the hormone of darkness. So, I just threw a lot of biology at you. And I'm not saying you're like a Siberian hamster, at least not in ways that I'm aware of. I'm not saying that your pelage color is going to change. Actually the reason people go gray is because when you're really stressed, did you know this, that when you're really stressed, there's an increase in the nerve fibers that release adrenaline to the hair follicle and that activates peroxide groups in the hair follicle that cause the hair to actually go gray or white. So actually stress does make your hair gray or white. Aging does it too. That was a brief aside, but for those of you that are interested in the relationship between light and skin tone and all that kind of stuff, I thought you might find it interesting that the cells in your eye are a lot like these skin cells in frogs or in animals that shift their entire color and sometimes metamorphosize. You know, there are some species that literally change shape in their reproductive organs. In fact, if that wasn't weird enough, when I was in graduate school at Berkeley, there was another graduate student studying a species of hermaphroditic mole, right, those little things that dig, hermaphrodite mole that would change from having ovaries to testes and back again depending on day life. Super cool, super different, and wild biological mechanism. If you're wondering how those animals reproduce they actually adjust the numbers of males and females depending on the density of males and females. So if there are too many males, some of the males turn their testes into ovaries. And if there're too many females, they turn their ovaries into testes. They actually are true hermaphroditic animals as opposed to as pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay, let's get back on track. Let's talk about the animal that most of you care about which is the human animal. New parents and babies. All right, as I mentioned earlier, melatonin is not cyclic, it's not cycling in babies, it's more phasic. It's being released at a kind of a constant level. And babies tend to be smaller than adults, they are. And so those concentrations of melatonin are very high. As the baby grows, those concentrations per unit volume are going to go down. Babies are not born with a typical sleep wake cycle. And now all the parents are saying, tell me something I didn't know. They also have, and I really want to emphasize this, they also have much more sensitive optics of the eye. So a number of people have asked me, you know, should I be exposing my baby to sunlight? You don't want to avoid sunlight, but their eyes are very sensitive, the optics of their eyes aren't quite developed so much so that you know when you look at a newborn baby and they look a little glassy-eyed and they're kind of looking through you or even a young child. A lot of people think that they're seeing you the way that you're seeing them. Hate to break it to you, but if you ever can just google visual image of a like a one month old. The optics of their eyes are so poor that you're a cloudy image. They're not seeing your fine detail. As the optics get better, then they will see you with more and more clarity. But a lot of that is clearing of the lens and some of the other aqueous features of the newborn eye, they don't see very well. But they also don't have such great ways of adjusting to bright light. And so babies have a natural aversion to bright lights. So you really want to avoid trying to use sunlight or really bright light in the same way that you would for an adult on a young baby or child. As children get older however, melatonin does start to become slightly more cyclic, slightly more cycled, and their body temperature rhythms also start to fall into a more regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm, they're more of these ultradian rhythms. So in episode, I think it was one or two of the podcast, or maybe both, we talked about these 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, where every 90 minutes babies are going through a cycle of body temperature and some other hormonal features. I mean, so much is changing in their system. So what to do if a child isn't sleeping? You can use phases of darkness and phases of light but they're going to have to be shortened in order to try and encourage sleep when you want the child to sleep. It's not that they're just not going to fall into an adult-like regime of a temperature minimum and a temperature maximum. Their temperature minimums and maximums are fluctuating much more quickly. And it varies tremendously. Actually there's an interesting literature of whether or not they have siblings, whether or not they're twins, whether or not they're in a nursery environment, whether or not they're alone, hopefully the baby's not alone, but you know what I mean, that they're sleeping alone in a room while you're in the other room. There are a couple of things that seem to help which is getting the overall environment into a 24 hour schedule. So having the room slightly colder, obviously you want babies to be nice and cozy, slightly colder when you would like them to be asleep, slightly warmer for the times you would like them to be awake. Babies tend to run pretty hot anyway. And obviously you want to be very careful about avoiding all extremes of temperature, cold or hot. So if they're going through these 90 minute cycles, you're going to have to adjust to those 90 minute cycles as well. So then people say, well, that's not going to help me at all because how do I deal with the fact that I need to be up every 90 minutes at night? There are a couple tools that can be helpful. The first one is going to be to try and understand the relationship between calm and deep sleep. So the autonomic nervous system can put us into states of panic, where that's kind of seesaw of autonomic alertness, goes all the way to panic. Or it can be alertness, or it can be alert and calm, right? So there's a range there, it's a continuum. It can also be that you're in deep sleep, so the other end of the seesaw is way up or you're your in light sleep or you're kind of sleepy, or you're just feeling kind of relaxed. Perhaps the most important thing if you're having to map to a baby schedule in order to make sure that they're getting changings, and nursing, etc, at the appropriate times, is to try and maintain, if you can't sleep or you can't sleep continuously, to try and maintain your autonomic nervous system in a place where you're not going into heightened states of alertness when you would ideally be sleeping. Now, I realize that this could be translated to try and stay calm while you're sleep deprived, which is very hard for people to do. But this is where the non-sleep deep rest protocols surface again and can potentially be very beneficial for people to be able to recover, not necessarily sleep, but for them to maintain a certain amount of autonomic regulation. So what would this look like? This would look like, the baby goes down, maybe it's only going to go down for 45 minutes. If you can capture sleep, capture sleep. There are some data showing what's called polyphasic sleep. If you can sleep in 45 minute increments or batches, even if it's spread throughout the day with periods of wakefulness in between, as miserable as that sound, there are actually some adults that have deliberately employed that, who don't have children for the sake of work productivity. And it does tend to reduce the total overall amount of sleep that you need. It is a very hard schedule for most people to maintain but if you have a baby, the baby may be throwing you into that kind of schedule anyway. So if you can get 45 minutes sleep while they sleep, great. If you can get another 45 minutes after waking and then they go back down to sleep, great. So as many phases of sleep as you can get. But if you can't sleep the data on non-sleep deep rest type protocols does show that at least from a neurochemical level, I want to be clear what that means, reset of things like dopamine levels in the basal ganglia measured by things like positron emission tomography, etc. Those things tend to reset themselves pretty well if you can access these deep rest state. So that means not being alert throughout the entire time that the baby is sleeping. Trying to sort of mirror the baby's sleep cycle which can be brutal for certain people, and especially if you're trying to prepare meals and do all these things. So I do recognize that there are a lot of constraints on parenting not just mapping on your baby's sleep schedule. As children approach ages one, two, three, four, that's when certainly the optics of the eyes have improved but you don't want to damage the eyes of course, with very bright light. They are much more sensitive even until they're kind of 10, 11 years old. And we'll talk about vision in children in a moment. But trying to get longer and longer batches of sleep through, hopefully not through the use of administering melatonin to the kids 'cause that's what I talked about before why that could potentially be detrimental talk about that with your doctor. But more so trying to get longer blocks of sleep that map onto these ultradian cycles. So it would be better off to get a three hour, like two-90 minute cycles, than a four hour batch of sleep because waking up in the middle of those ultradian cycles can just be brutal for parent and kid. So if one can't get a full six or 10, or some kids should even be sleeping 12 hours when they're growing quickly, trying to get batches of sleep even if they're fractured throughout the 24 hour cycle that are matched more to these 90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian cycle of 90 minutes, or two back to back, or three back to back to back. That's going to be better than waking up in the middle of an ultradian cycle. It's just going to set any number of other things in a better direction than were you to try to say, just enforce or force a full eight or 10 hours of sleep. That's at least what the literature shows. Some kids sleep great through the night, starting at a very young age, others don't. I typically hear from people who are struggling tremendously, they're losing their mind understandably, because they're not sleeping, their kid's not sleeping and, or their kid is sleeping for such brief periods. So in other words, try and access deep calm if you can't sleep, try and access sleep, if you can sleep even if it's fractured. And then you say, well, what about all the sunlight viewing and the exercise stuff? When sleep is really, really dismantled, meaning it's happening in various times of day or night, that's especially, at those times it's going to be especially important for the parent to get morning and evening sunlight because your circadian clock is going into a tailspin and it basically wants to anchor to something. So you want to give it two anchors, morning and evening light. Okay, so this is rather different than what I described for shift work, this is when things are really chaotic and you're just not able to sleep. Similar circumstances can arise if you're taking care of a very sick loved one, you're up all night. Try and stay calm using NSDR protocols, I know it's harder to do than to say, but those protocols are there, they're free, there's research to support them. Try and get sleep whenever you can but also try to get morning sunlight and evening sunlight in your eyes if you can and if you can't get that, use artificial light, okay? What about later life? So kids now, adolescents, teens, it is true that teens have a tendency to wake up later and go to sleep later. In part, just because they're sleeping a lot more. They're churning out gonadotropin-releasing hormone and luteinizing hormone. Their whole bodies are changing. I don't know whether or not people realize this, but the fastest rate of aging that any of us will ever undergo is puberty. That is the fastest rate of aging. And so there's a huge number of biological processes that are happening during puberty, probably devote a whole episode to puberty as a fascinating aspect to the life course but it is accelerated period of aging. And the circadian clock mechanisms sometimes are very intact, and sometimes they're a little dismantled and going through some change, but prioritize the duration of sleep for adolescents and teens. Now, if that means they're sleeping until 2:00 PM, and then waking up and then they're up all night, the up all night part can become a problem especially with all the devices, texting in their rooms or playing video games. Morning and evening sunlight would be ideal but some kids are just going to sleep through the morning sunlight. However, if you were to measure their temperature, what you would find is that their temperature minimum would come later in the morning. It's not going to be 8:00 AM. It's going to be maybe even 10:00 AM, if they're sleeping until 11 or 12. Or it might be 8:00 AM if they're sleeping until 10. Remember temperature minimum is two hours before your average waking time, typically. So in teens, it maximizes the total amount of sleep. Try and get regular sunlight either in the morning or in the evening or both. But if they're sleeping through the morning sunrise, that's probably not as much of an issue, waking them up and depriving them of sleep is probably worse because their T-min, their temperature minimum, is actually falling later. So their circadian dead zone is later, etc. So I think with adolescents and teens it makes sense to kind of give them a little bit more rope in terms of allowing them some leeway to adjust their own schedule. Some schools are even starting classes later on the basis of some very good biology to support this late shifted rhythm and this extended sleep phase. There are data from Dr. Jamie Zeitzer, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and others at Stanford, showing that turning on the lights in the room of a teen before they wake up helps them get more sleep the subsequent night, it also tricks them into going to sleep a little bit earlier. But it gives them about 45 minutes more of deep sleep. And that's been shown statistically, total sleep time increases as well. If they're hiding under the covers, that's not going to work, but their eyes don't have to be open. I know a few parents now that are coming in with a flashlight and flashing their kids over their eyelids before they wake up in hopes of getting this to work, some have told me this is working. That's not part of a standard study. But it does seem to work because, now you should know why, because if light's getting through the eyelids, and it's say 8:00 AM and the kid is still asleep and they're going to wake up at 10, you're giving them light just after or around their temperature minimum, which is going to make them want to go to sleep earlier. And in the case of teens, for some reason we don't quite understand, sleep longer, about 45 minutes longer, spend more time in deep sleep. Adults can do this too, if you can persuade someone or put your lights on timer for lights to go on before you wake up, that's really going to help you wake up earlier, okay. So if you're starting to hear some themes are really resounding over and over again, that should be reassuring to you, right. That these are core mechanisms. Fortunately, there aren't 1,000 different mechanisms. Now in the elderly, there's a real tendency to want to go to sleep very early and wake up very early. And people should talk to their physician. There is some evidence that melatonin levels and patterns of melatonin secretion can become a little chaotic in elderly folks. What do I mean by elderly? Well, it's going to differ. Rates of aging differ, right? You see some 65 year olds that are struggling to move and seem much older than some 65 year olds that are, you know, still hustling around and have tons of energy. There's a lot of variation, some of it's genetic, some of it's lifestyle factors, you know, it really varies. Certainly lifestyle factors can play an important role in rates of aging. I think that the most prominent results from sleep and circadian rhythms in the elderly are they need to get as much natural light, even if it's through windows. I realize that some elderly folks can't get outside as easily. It's not safe for them to do it, they can't move around as easily. Exercise can come in various forms for people that can't get outside and get a ton of sunlight by jogging or cycling. If they're not able to do that, light through window in that case, open window ideally, but for temperature reasons, etc, sometimes the window has to be closed. Getting people near that window and away from artificial light early in the day, and away from artificial lights during the night phase can have a tremendous effect. And in the elderly that's when melatonin might be a viable option. And this should be discussed with a physician, of course, but you know, you're way past the puberty time point. In most cases, people who are in their 70s, and 80s, and 90s, are not churning out a lot of GnRH and luteinizing hormone to begin with. And that's where struggles with falling asleep and staying asleep, all the same parameters and things we've described before still apply, light, exercise, temperature, etc, but that's where melatonin might be of greatest benefit. And again, I'm not pushing melatonin here but I think for elderly folks who are having trouble falling and staying asleep, that might be worthwhile. There are, and I should just also mention that regular schedule for folks that are elderly and as much natural light as safely possible, those are going to be the key levers for adjusting sleep in circadian schedules. I've mentioned before in previous podcasts, other supplements besides melatonin. And some of those supplements are quite good for sleep. You know, I'm not a supplement pusher, I am somebody who takes supplements, I believe in them, some have worked for me some have not worked as well, but I certainly believe in getting the behaviors right. Whether or not it's NSDR protocols, viewing natural light, exercise, hot baths, or cold showers, or what have you, behavioral protocols first. There are some supplements that I've mentioned in previous podcasts but I've seemed to get a lot of questions about. So I just want to take a couple minutes and just talk about some of the supplements that can be beneficial for helping turning off thinking, accessing deeper sleep, and even being able to compact your sleep schedule into a shorter period of hours, meaning getting by well with less sleep. People take a lot of sleeping pills. I'm not going to tell people not to take sleeping pills. They can be very problematic, habit-forming, high side- effect incidents in many cases, some people can handle them just fine. Again, I'm no physician, I'm not prescribing anything. I'm a professor, so I profess a lot of things some of which are my opinion. Although, if you look at the scientific literature, there are some impressive data around some non-prescription drug type supplements that have fairly high safety margins that you might consider but you should talk to your doctor always before adding or taking anything out of your health regimes, right? Your health is not my responsibility, it's your responsibility, so be a stringent filter. Along those lines, one of the most powerful and useful tools that I've mentioned here on many times and I plan to mention many many more times, is the website examine.com which I have no affiliation with but is a wonderful site that links you to quality peer reviewed studies relating to just about any supplement including some safety warnings. Will also tell you what subjects, whether or not it was rats, cats, elderly folks or kids, that a given study was done on, which is important, can be kind of hard to pull from sites where people are just advertising supplements, right? They usually don't tell you what the study was and who were these rats, who were these kids, etc. There are three supplements that at least for me have had a tremendously positive effect on my sleep that some of you might consider. I would say, if you're doing everything properly behaviorally and you're still having issues, then supplements might be a good thing for you. Or if you are traveling and you want a little bit of extra help in buffering your sleep wakefulness protocols. Some people like to go just to the supplements. They're like, what should I take? I have people in my life that are like, just tell me what to take, you know. I'm more of, here's what you might want to do or not do and then think about what you might want to take or not take. But personal preference and it's a free country, so you can do what you like. Magnesium. So magnesium has been shown to increase the depth of sleep and has been shown to decrease the amount of time that it takes to access sleep, to fall asleep. It comes in various forms. I've talked a bunch of times about magnesium threonate, T-H- R-E-O-N-A-T-E, threonate. which seems to be the more bioavailable form of magnesium. And magnesium threonate it seems is shadowed preferentially to the brain which is where you want it. And there's certain transporters, it actually engages the GABA pathway which tends to turn off certain areas of the forebrain and allows you to kind of fall asleep. There is a study, if you'd like to explore it since people serious about supplementation might want to explore the study, which is Ates et al, A-T-E-S Dose- Dependent Absorption Profile of Different Magnesium Compounds. Looks to me like a quality peer reviewed paper. I can put the link in the caption, and it explores all the different forms of magnesium. It does seem like magnesium glycinate can be similar to magnesium threonate in terms of which tissues it is shadow to. Magnesium malate, M-A- L-A-T-E, is preferentially shadow to the muscle, it appears, as opposed to the brain. So it's going to be more of a muscle repair type thing or restoring magnesium stores in the periphery as opposed to the brain. Magnesium citrate has another name that I won't mention ingest, because magnesium citrate's main effect, at least on me and the people I know, seems to be a laxative effect as opposed to a cognitive effect. There's also some evidence that magnesium threonate can be neuroprotective. Those data come from quality labs, mostly rodent studies, not human studies, but it's kind of interesting. And again, the safety margins for these things tend to be pretty high, but anytime you're going to take something new you should approach it with caution, especially since magnesium could be involved in heart rhythm and things of that sort. The other supplement that has been very beneficial for me is theanine. So this is T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E. Theanine activates certain GABA pathways which are involved in turning off top-down processing and thinking, making it easier to fall asleep. And theanine, 100 milligrams to 300 milligrams has a calming effect. Theanine is now showing up in a number of different energy drinks and even some coffees as a way to try and get people to ingest more of a given type of coffee 'cause the idea is it will take away the jitters and the anxiety, allowing people to drink more coffee. I'm talking about taking magnesium and theanine 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime not during the day to quell anxiety, but rather 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime with or without food, for me hasn't made a difference. And the combination of those two things has really helped. Theanine for sleepwalkers can be a problem. It does increase the intensity of your dreams, it gives you very vivid dreams. So for sleep walkers or people that get night terrors stay away from theanine is my advice. Magnesium theanine might be something to explore for those of you that don't have those issues. With the emphasis on might. And then I've talked about a compound, and last time I talked about the mechanisms of apigenin which is a derivative of chamomile, A-P-I-G-E-N, which acts as a little bit of a hypnotic by activating chloride channels, hyperpolarized neurons, increases GABA in the brain, basically makes you feel a little sleepy. And chamomile, for those of you that read your what was it that Peter Rabbits snuck into Mr. McGregor's garden, ate the chamomile, fell asleep, Mr. Gregory came back. Okay, anyone flashing back to elementary school? Okay. There's a story about chamomile having these kind of sedative-like effects, apigenin is highly concentrated chamomile also has intra- estrogenic effects. So if you want to keep your estrogen up you might want to be cautious about apigenin. That's where things like examine.com become really useful because you can go to examine you put in apigenin, and it'll tell you all the things that it does and all the things that it does can sometimes include things that you had no idea, like reducing conversion of certain androgens to estrogens which you might like or you might want to avoid. That's up to you and where you want your estrogen levels depending on who you are and what your life circumstances and goals are. A few other things that can help the transition to sleep, are things like 5-HTP L-tryptophan. I've talked about why I'm not a fan of those for me, they tend to throw me into deep sleep and then I wake up and I can't fall back asleep. So I don't like to tinker with my serotonin system, I don't like to tinker with my dopamine system, for entirely other reasons but none of which are particularly concerning it's just that I find that if I increase my dopamine by taking L- Tyrosine in pill form, then I crash really hard the next day. Or if I take 5-HTP L- tryptophan I fall deeply asleep and then I wake up. But I didn't mention that there might be ways to make sleep more compact. And so this is actually a request to you. I had a really interesting experience when I was a postdoc. I went for the first time to an acupuncturist. I know there're varying thoughts and opinions out there about acupuncture. I can't say that I've benefit so much from the acupuncture. There are now quality peer reviewed studies showing publishing neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal, showing that acupuncture can stimulate some anti- inflammatory compounds depending on where the acupuncture is done. These are really good studies, came out last year. I talked about this on Instagram, I may talk about it again. As well as certain acupuncture sites that increase inflammation. So, you know, you can get different types of effects, you can't just say acupuncture is great across the board. And I'm assuming that the acupuncturist know which sites are good for increasing inflammation, which ones are good for decreasing inflammation. However, this acupuncturist that I went to gave me these red pills. He said, these are minerals for sleep, and it was remarkable. I took the red pills. Isn't that a thing now? Take the red pill. I don't know what that means, right, 'cause I'm not tuned in. But these red pills looked like little M&Ms, I took a couple of them on his suggestion and I fell deeply asleep and four hours later woke up feeling incredibly rested, more rested than I had ever felt in my entire life and I never required more than four hours sleep. Unfortunately, acupuncturist moved away, I never figured out what was in those red pills. I didn't get a chance to do the mass spectroscopy, and I still wonder, he said they were minerals. So somebody out there knows what these red pills are and what this compound is. And it was incredible, and I would love to know what those are. So if you know, please don't go taking red pills at random to try and recreate this non-experiment experience of mine. But please do contact me if you find out or if you're an acupuncturist and you know what these mysterious red pills were, because they were pretty awesome. Once again, I've thrown a tremendous amount of information at you. I hope you will figure out your temperature minimum and start working with that to access the sleep and wakeful cycles that you want to access. I hope that you will explore NSDR. You might want to explore supplementation if that's your thing. You have now access to a lot of mechanism about sleep and wakefulness. But in keeping with the theme of this podcast, where we stay on topic for an entire month or even slightly more, we are not done with sleep and wakefulness. I know this is very different than the typical podcast format, where one week it's how to become superhuman and the next week it's how to, you know, develop growth mindset and it's kind of all over the place with episode to episode. We are staying on track because I really believe that as we drill deeper and deeper into these mechanisms, and you start hearing some of the same themes again and again, you're going to start to develop an intuition and an understanding of how these systems work in you and your particular life circumstances. And my goal is really to eventually become obsolete. It's what my graduate advisor used to call the hit by a bus principle. She had a somewhat morbid sense of humor and used to be, well, if I get hit by a bus tomorrow, what are you going to do without me blabbing at you here? So I don't want to get hit by a bus, I plan on living a very long time, if I have anything to say about it. But were I to get hit by a bus tomorrow, what would you do for your sleep and wakefulness, right? You could put a comment on YouTube, which I hope you will do. But if I were hit by a bus and killed then I wouldn't be able to answer your question. So know your temperature minimum, understand light in the early part of the day is valuable. Light when you want to be awake, provided it's not so bright it's damaging. It's great for you whether or not it comes from screens or sunlight but sunlight's better. Avoid light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum or else you're going to delay your clock unless you're traveling and that's what you want to do. Okay? Use temperature, increase temperature to shift your clock, decrease temperature to delay your clock, okay? Map out your temperature and understand it. You don't have to know degree by degree across the day, know your minimum, know your maximum temperature in your 24 hour cycle and you'll feel great power through that because then you'll know also about these ultradian cycles, these 90 minute cycles within which you can do focused work. Don't expect the focus to come early, expect focus to come in the middle and then kind of taper off. I talked a little bit about kids, a little bit about elderly, about parenting, we are going to continue, there's going to be more. But now shift workers, travelers, people that are jet lagging themselves at home, you now have levers in place. Information can be powerful but you have to implement it in ways, obviously safe ways and reasonable ways. But implementing this knowledge in the ways that you trust are safe and reasonable for you is going to be the way that you can develop a bit of a laboratory about yourself. I loath the term biohacking, sorry, biohackers. I don't believe in hacking anything. I believe in understanding mechanism and applying the principles of mechanism for which there are large bodies of quality peer reviewed data, and even a whole center of mass around certain biological principles, like the effects of light and temperature, temperature minimums, that will allow you to shift your biology in the ways that you want it to go. That will allow you to shift your psychology in the ways you want to go. Next podcast episode, we are going to talk more about a few things. First of all, we're going to answer more of your questions 'cause during office hours, I didn't get to all your questions from the previous episode. So I do read the comments and we're paying attention and figuring out the most common questions. We are going to get to some of the harder topics. Someone came at me, it's always fun when somebody does this, they said, well, these are just the kind of basal low-level questions. What about the big stuff? What about dreaming and lucid dreaming and consciousness? Look, I'll talk about that stuff. And I'm planning to do that, some of which in the next episode and the following episode maybe even. But I want to give you data. I want to give you things that are supported by data. So I will try to speculate as little as possible because this is a podcast about science and science-based tools for everyday life. This is not about me speculating. Many people have speculated about the role of sleep, dreaming and consciousness. Fascinating topics, and a rather circular argument frankly, it's been going on for centuries. Someday we'll get there, right now we're concentrating on these deep biological mechanisms that make you who you are and allow you to feel certain ways, good or bad, allow you to function physically in certain ways, good or bad, and give you more of a sense of control. That's my goal here. Many people have quite graciously asked how they can help support the podcast. First of all, thank you, we appreciate the question. You can support the podcast by subscribing to the podcast on YouTube, as well as subscribing on Apple or Spotify. And you can also leave us comments and feedback on YouTube and at Apple that really helps. We would hope the feedback would be positive, but nonetheless, leave us feedback, ask questions, we will use those questions to create future content for the podcast. As well, if you can recommend the podcast to friends and family and other people that you think might find the information of use, that's terrific. And check out our sponsors that we mentioned at the beginning. That's a really great way to help support us and our ability to bring you this information. Along those lines, a lot of people have asked me about supplements and supplement companies. So up until now I've been reluctant to recommend specific supplement brands. The supplement industry is kind of a wild west of different brands, different levels of quality and stringency. It can be very complicated and what's on the bottle is not always what you're getting. The quality of what you're getting varies from company to company, and even from substance to substance, batch to batch. So I'm pleased to say that I'm partnering with Thorne, Thorne, spelled T-H-O-R-N-E, is a supplement company that works with the Mayo Clinic, and with pretty much all the major sports team organizations and that I know to have the highest levels of stringency in terms of what's in the bottle matches what's listed on the bottle, and in terms of the quality of what they put in those supplements. So, while I mentioned earlier, that supplements aren't for everybody. If you're interested in trying some of these supplements you might want to check out Thorne. If you want to do that you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman. So it's t-h-o-r-n-e.com, c-o-m slash the letter u slash huberman, and if you do that, they'll give you 20% off any of the supplements that you happen to purchase from Thorne. Thanks so much for your time and attention. I really appreciate it. See you next time on the Huberman Lab Podcast. And as always, thanks for your interest in science.

I\\'m Andrew Huberman, and I\\'m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools. In keeping with that theme, I\\'d like to thank the sponsors of today\\'s podcast. Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses that are ideally suited to your sleep needs. Helix mattresses are amazing. I can say this because I\\'ve been sleeping on one and I\\'ve been sleeping better than I\\'ve ever slept before. The interesting thing about Helix mattresses is that they\\'re tailored to your unique body type and sleeping style. What\\'s a sleeping style? Well, if you go to the Helix site you can take a quick quiz, it takes about two minutes, as to whether or not you sleep on your stomach, your side, your back, whether or not you flip back and forth, or whether or not you don\\'t know in what position you sleep, as well as whether or not you tend to run hot or run cold, wake up cold, wake up hot, et cetera. If you do that then it will match you to the mattress that\\'s perfect for your sleep needs. If you wanna try a Helix mattress, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman. And if you do that, you\\'ll get $200 off your order as well as two free pillows. That\\'s helixsleep.com/huberman. The second sponsor of today\\'s podcast is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I\\'ve been using Athletic Greens since 2012, and I started using it because I had a lot of confusion about what vitamins and minerals I should take. And taking Athletic Greens allowed me to get the foundation or sort of the base of everything I need in one easy to consume formula. It tastes great. I mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon juice, and I like drinking it. And the probiotics in there are important to me as well, because there are a lot of data out there now identifying the gut microbiome and the importance of the gut-brain axis for immune function, metabolic function and so forth. If you want to try Athletic Greens you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman. And if you do that they\\'ll also send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3, K2. There are a lot of data starting to surface about the importance of vitamin D3 for immune function, metabolic function, endocrine function, and so forth. In addition, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, you\\'ll get the year supply of D3 and K2 as well as five free travel packs, which are a little packets of Athletic Greens in addition to your normal order. And those are great for when you\\'re on the plane, or you\\'re otherwise traveling. They mix up really easily without any mess or the needs of spoon out powder and things of that sort. So the things that are easy to do at home are kind of harder on the road, those packets make it easy while on the road. Today we\\'re gonna talk about dreaming, learning during dreaming and unlearning during dreaming. In particular unlearning of troubling emotional events. Now my interest in dreaming goes way back. When I was a child I had a friend and he came over one day and he brought with him a mask that had a little red light in the corner. He had purchased this thing through some magazine ad that he had seen, and this mask was supposed to trigger lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming is the experience of dreaming during sleep, but being aware that one is dreaming. And in some cases being able to direct one\\'s dream activities. So if you\\'re in a lucid dream and you wanna fly, for instance, some people report being able to initiate that experience of flying. Or to contort themselves into an animal, or to transport themselves to wherever they want within the dream. I tried this device. The way it worked is you put on the mask during a waking state, I\\'m wide awake, and you look at the little light flashing in the corner, and then you\\'d also wear it when you went to sleep at night. And indeed, while I was asleep I could see the red light presumably through my eyelids. Although, for all I know I had opened my eyes. I don\\'t know I was asleep. And then, because I was dreaming and I was experiencing something very vivid, I was able to recognize that I was dreaming and then start to direct some of the events within that dream. Now lucid dreaming occurs in about 20% of people and in a small percentage of those people they lucid dream almost every night. So much so that many of them report their sleep not being as restorative as it would be otherwise. Now all of this is to say that, lucid dreaming and dreaming are profound experiences. We tend to feel extremely attached to our dream experience. This may explain the phenomenon of people who have a very intense dream they need to somehow tell everybody about that dream, or tell someone about that dream. I don\\'t really know what that behavior is about, but sometimes we wake up and we feel so attached to what happened in this state that we call dreaming that there seems to be an intense need to share it with other people, presumably to process it and make sense of it. Now numerous people throughout history have tried to make sense of dreams in some sort of organized way. The most famous of which of course is a Sigmund Freud who talked about symbolic representations in dreams. A lot of that has been kind of debunked. Although, I think that there\\'s some interest in what the symbols of dreaming are. And this is something that we\\'ll talk about in more depth today, although not Freud in theory, in particular. So I think in order to really think about dreams and what to do with them and how to maximize the dream experience for sake of learning and unlearning, the best way to address this is to look at the physiology of sleep, to really address what do we know concretely about sleep. So first of all, as we get sleepy we tend to shut our eyes, and that\\'s \\'cause there\\'s some autonomic centers in the brain, some neurons that control closing of the eyelids when we get sleepy. And then we transitioned into sleep. And sleep, regardless of how long we sleep is generally broken up into a series of 90 minute cycles. These ultradian cycles. So early in the night these 90 minute cycles tend to be comprised more of shallow sleep and slow wave sleep. So stage one, stage two, et cetera, and what we call slow wave sleep. I\\'ll go into detail about what all this means in a moment. And we tend to have less so-called REM sleep, R-E-M sleep, which stands for rapid eye movement sleep. And I\\'ll talk about rapid eye movement sleep in detail. So early in the night, a lot more slow wave sleep and less REM. For every 90 minute cycle that we have during a night of sleep we tend to start having more and more REM sleep. So more of that 90 minute cycle is comprised of REM sleep and less of slow wave sleep. Now this is true regardless of whether or not you wake up in the middle of the night to use the restroom or your sleep is broken. The more sleep you\\'re getting across the night, the more REM sleep you\\'re going to have. And REM sleep and non REM, as I\\'ll refer to it, have distinctly different roles in learning and unlearning, and they are responsible for learning and unlearning of distinctly different types of information. And this has enormous implications for learning of motor skills, for unlearning of traumatic events, or for processing emotionally challenging as well as emotionally pleasing events. And as we\\'ll see, one can actually leverage their daytime activities in order to access more slow wave sleep or non REM sleep as we\\'ll call it, or more REM sleep depending on your particular emotional and physical needs. So it\\'s really a remarkable stage of life that we have a lot more control and power over then you might believe. We\\'ll also talk about lucid dreaming. We\\'re also gonna talk about hallucinations and how drug induced hallucinations have a surprising similarity to a lot of dream states and yet some really important differences. Okay. So let\\'s start by talking about slow wave sleep, or non REM sleep. And I realized that slow wave sleep and non REM sleep aren\\'t exactly the same thing. So for you sleep aficionados out there, I am lumping right now. As we say in science, there are lumpers and there are splitters and I am both. Sometimes I lump, sometimes I split. For sake of clarity and ease of conversation right now I\\'m gonna be a lumper. When I say slow wave sleep, I mean non REM sleep generally. Although, I acknowledge there is a distinction. Slow wave sleep. So slow wave sleep is characterized by a particular pattern of brain activity in which the brain is metabolically active, but that there\\'s these big sweeping waves of activity that include a lot of the brain. If you wanna look this up you can find evidence for sweeping of waves of neural activity across association cortex, across big swaths of the brainstem, the so-called pons geniculate occipital pathway. This is brainstem, thalamus, and then cortex for those of you that are interested. Although, more of that is going to occur in REM sleep. Now the interesting thing about slow wave sleep are the neuromodulators that tend to be associated with it, that are most active and least active during slow wave sleep and here\\'s why. To remind you neuromodulators are these chemicals that act rather slowly but their main role is to bias particular brain circuits to be active and other brain circuits to not be active. These are like the music playlist. So think of neuromodulators and these come in the names of, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine, think of them as suggesting playlists on your audio device. So, you know, classical music is distinctly different in feel and tone and a number of other features from like third wave punk, or from, you know, hip hop, right? So think of them as biasing toward particular genres of neural circuit activity, okay. Mellow music versus really aggressive fast music, or rhythmic music that includes lyrics versus rhythmic music that doesn\\'t include lyrics. It\\'s more or less the way to think about these neuromodulators. And they are associated as a consequence with certain brain functions. So we know for instance and just to review, acetylcholine in waking states is a neuromodulator that tends to amplify the activity of brain circuits associated with focus and attention. Norepinephrine is a neuromodulator that tends to amplify the brain circuits associated with alertness, and the desire to move. Serotonin is the neuromodulator that\\'s released intense to amplify the circuits in the brain and body that are associated with bliss and the desire to remain still. And dopamine is the neuromodulator that\\'s released and is associated with amplification of the neural circuits in the brain and body associated with pursuing goals and pleasure and reward. Okay. So in slow wave sleep something really interesting happens. There is essentially no acetylcholine. Acetylcholine production and release and action from the two major sites, which are in the brainstem, which from a nucleus if it\\'s a parabigerminal nucleus, if you really wanna know, or from the forebrain, which is nucleus basalis. And you don\\'t need to know these names but if you like, that\\'s why I put them out there. Acetylcholine production plummets. It\\'s just almost to zero. And acetylcholine as I just mentioned, is associated with focus. So you can think of slow wave sleep as these big sweeping waves of activity through the brain and a kind of distortion of space and time, so that we\\'re not really focusing on any one thing. Now the other molecules that are very active at that time are norepinephrine. Which is a little bit surprising \\'cause normally in waking states norepinephrine is gonna be associated with a lot of alertness and the desire to move. But there\\'s not a ton of norepinephrine around in slow wave sleep, but it is around. So there\\'s something associated with the movement circuitry going on in slow wave sleep. And remember, this is happening mostly at the beginning of the night, your sleep is dominated by slow wave sleep. So no acetylcholine, very little norepinephrine, although there is some and a lot of serotonin. And serotonin again is associated with this desire, this sensation of kind of bliss or wellbeing, but not a lot of movement. And during sleep you tend not to move. Now in slow wave sleep you can move, you\\'re not paralyzed. So you can roll over. If people are going to sleep walk, typically it\\'s going to be during slow wave sleep. And what studies have shown through some kind of sadistic experiments where people are deprived specifically of slow wave sleep, and that can be done by waking them up as soon as the electrode recording show that they\\'re in slow wave sleep or by chemically altering their sleep so that it biases them away from slow wave sleep. What studies have shown is that motor learning is generally occurring in slow wave sleep. So let\\'s say the day before you go to sleep you were learning some new dance move, or you were learning some specific motor skill, either a fine motor skill or a course motor skill. So let\\'s say, it\\'s a new form of exercise or some new coordinated movements. This could be coordinate movement at the level of the fingers, or it could be coordinated movement the level of whole body and large limb movements. It could involve other people, or it could be a solo activity. Learning of those skills is happening primarily during slow wave sleep in the early part of the night. In addition, slow wave sleep has been shown to be important for the learning of detailed information. Now this isn\\'t always cognitive information. We\\'re gonna talk about cognitive information, but the studies that have been done along these lines involve having people learn very detailed information about very specific rules and the way that certain words are spelled, they tend to be challenging words. So if people are tested and in terms of their performance on these types of exams and they\\'re deprived of slow wave sleep, they tend to perform very poorly. So we can think of slow wave sleep as important for motor learning, motor skill learning and for the learning of specific details about specific events. And this turns out to be fundamentally important because now we know that slow wave sleep is primarily in the early part of the night, and motor learning is occurring primarily early in the night, and detailed learning is occurring early in the night. Now for those of you that are waking up after only three, four hours of sleep, this might be informative. This might tell you a little something about what you are able to learn and not able to learn if that were to be the only sleep that you get. Although, hopefully that\\'s not the only sleep that you get. But we\\'re going to dive deep into how it is that one can maximize motor learning in order to extract say, more detail information about coordinated movements and how to make them faster or slower. So that might be important for certain sports. It might be almost certainly important for certain sports. It\\'s gonna be important for any kind of coordinated movement, like say learning to play the piano, or for instance, how to learn synchronized movements with somebody else. So maybe I mentioned the example of dance earlier. Like me a few years ago, I set out to learn tango because I have some Argentine relatives and I was a Bismal. I need to return to that at some point. I was just a Bismal. And one of the worst things about being a bismal at learning dance is that, that somebody else has to suffer the consequences also. So I don\\'t know maybe in the month on neuroplasticity, I\\'ll explore that again as a self experimentation. But, the key things to know are slow wave sleep is involved in motor learning and detailed learning. There\\'s no acetylcholine around at that time, has these big amplitude activity sweeping throughout the brain and that there\\'s the release of these neuromodulators, norepinephrine and serotonin. And again, that\\'s all happening early in the night. So athletes, people that are concerned about performance, if you happen to wake up after just a couple hours of, you know, three, four hours of sleep because you\\'re excited about a competition the next day, presumably if you\\'ve already trained the skills that you need for the event you should be fine to engage in that particular activity. Now it\\'s always going to be better to get a full night\\'s sleep. And that, you know, a full night\\'s sleep for you is six hours then it\\'s always gonna be better to get more sleep than it is to get less. However, I think some people get a little bit overly concerned that if they didn\\'t get their full night\\'s sleep before some sort of physical event that their performance is going to plummet. Presumably, if you\\'ve already learned what you need to do, and it\\'s stored in your neural circuits and you know how to make those coordinated movements, what the literature on slow wave sleep suggest is that you would be replenished. That the motor learning and the recovery from exercise is going to happen early in the night. Okay. So we\\'ll just pause there, and kind of shelve that for a moment and then we\\'re gonna come back to it. But I wanna talk about REM sleep, or rapid eye movement sleep. REM sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, as I mentioned before, occurs throughout the night, but you\\'re gonna have more of it. A larger percentage of these 90 minute sleep cycles is going to be comprised of REM sleep as you get toward morning. REM sleep is fascinating. It was discovered in \\'50s when a sleep laboratory in Chicago, the researchers observed that people\\'s eyes were moving under their eyelids. Now, something very important that we\\'re going to address when we talk about trauma later is that, the eye movements are not just side to side they\\'re very erratic in all different directions. One thing that I don\\'t think I\\'ve never heard anyone really talk about publicly is, why eye movements during sleep, right? Eyes are closed. And sometimes people\\'s eyelids will be a little bit open and their eyes are darting around, especially in little kids. I don\\'t suggest you do this. I\\'m not even sure it\\'s ethical. But, it has been done where you, you know, pull back the eyelids of a kid while they\\'re sleeping and their eyes are kind of darting all over the place. I think people do this to their passed out friends at parties and things like that. So again, I don\\'t suggest you do it, but I\\'m telling you it because it\\'s been done before and therefore you don\\'t have to do it again. But rapid eye movement sleep is fascinating and occurs because there are connections between the brainstem, an area called the pons, and areas of the thalamus and the top of the brain stem that are involved in generating movements in different directions, sometimes called saccades. Although, sometimes during rapid eye movement sleep it\\'s not just rapid, it\\'s kind of a jittery side to side thing and then the eyeballs kind of role. It\\'s really pretty creepy to look at if you see. So what\\'s happening there is the circuitry that is involved in conscious eye movements is kind of going haywire, but it\\'s not haywire. It\\'s these waves of activity from the brainstem up to the so- called thalamus, which is an area that filter sensory information and then up to the cortex. And the cortex of course, is involved in conscious perceptions. So in rapid eye movement sleep there are a couple of things are happening besides rapid eye movements. The main ones are that they\\'re, I should say, in contrast to slow wave sleep. In REM sleep serotonin is essentially absent. Okay? So this molecule, this neuromodulator that tends to create the feeling of bliss and wellbeing and just calm placidity is absent. All right. So that\\'s interesting. In addition to that, norepinephrine this molecule that\\'s involved in movement and alertness is absolutely absent. It\\'s probably one of the few times in our life that epinephrin is essentially at zero activity within our system. And that has a number of very important implications for the sorts of dreaming that occur during REM sleep and the sorts of learning that can occur in REM sleep and unlearning. First of all in REM sleep, we are paralyzed. We are experiencing what\\'s called atonia, which just means that we\\'re completely laid out and paralyzed. We also tend to experience whatever it is that we\\'re dreaming about as a kind of hallucination, or a hallucinatory activity. Long ago I looked into hallucinations and dreaming I was just fascinated by this in high school. And there\\'s some great books on this if you\\'re interested in exploring the relationship between hallucinations and dreaming. The most famous of which are from a guy, a researcher at Harvard, Alan Hobson, you know, wrote a book called, Dream Drug Store. And talked all about the similarities between drugs that induce hallucinations and dreaming in REM. So you can explore that if you like. So in REM our eyes are moving, but the rest of our body is paralyzed and we are hallucinating. There\\'s no epinephrin around. Epinephrin doesn\\'t just create a desire to move and alertness. It is also the chemical signature of fear and anxiety. It\\'s what\\'s released from our adrenal glands when we experience something that\\'s fearful or alerting. So if a car suddenly screeches in front of us, or we get a troubling text message, adrenaline is deployed into our system. Adrenaline is epinephrin, those are equivalent molecules. And epinephrin isn\\'t just released from our adrenals it\\'s also released within our brain. So there\\'s this weird stage of our life that happens more toward morning, that we call REM sleep, where we\\'re hallucinating and having these outrageous experiences in our mind, but the chemical that\\'s associated with fear and panic and anxiety is not available to us. And that turns out to be very important. And you can imagine why that\\'s important. It\\'s important because it allows us to experience things, both replay of things that did occur as well as elaborate contortions of things that didn\\'t occur. And it allows us to experience those in the absence of fear and anxiety, and that it turns out is very important for adjusting our emotional relationship to challenging things that happened to us while we were awake. Those challenging things can sometimes be in the form of social anxiety, or just having been working very hard or concern about an upcoming event, or sometimes people report for instance, dreams where they find themselves late to an exam, or naked in public, or in some sort of situation that would be very troubling to them. And that almost certainly occurs during REM sleep. So we have this incredible period of sleep in which our experience of emotionally laid in events is dissociated. It\\'s chemically blocked from us having the actual emotion. Now probably immediately some of you are thinking, \"Well, what about nightmares? I have nightmares and those carry a lot of emotion, or sometimes I\\'ll wake up in a panic.\" Let\\'s consider each of those two things separately because they are important in understanding REM sleep. There\\'s a good chance that nightmares are occurring slow wave sleep. There are actually some drugs that I don\\'t suggest people take. In fact so much so I\\'m not gonna mention them that give people very kind of scary or eerie dreams and this kind of feeling that things are pursuing them, or that they can\\'t move when they are being chased. That\\'s actually a common dream that I\\'ve had. I guess, it\\'s more or less a nightmare. The feeling that one is paralyzed and can\\'t move and is being chased. A lot of people have said, \"Oh, that must be in REM sleep.\" Because you\\'re paralyzed and so you\\'re dreaming about being paralyzed and you can\\'t move. I think that\\'s probably false. The research says that because no epinephrine is absent during REM sleep, it\\'s very unlikely that you can have these intense, fearful memories. So those are probably occurring in slow wave sleep. Although, there might be instances where people have nightmares in REM sleep. The other thing is some people experience, certainly I\\'ve had this experience, of waking up and feeling very stressed about whatever it was that I happen to be thinking about, or dreaming about in the moments before. And that\\'s an interesting case of an invasion of the dream state into the waking state and the moment you wake up epinephrine is available. So the research on this isn\\'t fully crystallized, but most of it points in the direction of the experience of waking up and feeling very panicked. Maybe, I wanna highlight may, but maybe that you were experiencing something that was troubling in the daytime, you\\'re repeating that experience in your sleep, epinephrine is not available, and therefore the brain circuits associated with fear and anxiety are shut off. And so you\\'re able to process those events and then suddenly you wake up and there\\'s a surge of adrenaline of epinephrin that\\'s now coupled to that experience. So nightmares very likely in slow wave sleep and that kind of panic on waking from something very likely to be an invasion of the thoughts and ideas, however distorted in REM sleep invading the waking state. In fact, that brings to mind something that I\\'ve mentioned once before, but I wanna mention again, this atonia, this paralysis that we experience during sleep can invade the waking state. Many people report the experience of waking up and being paralyzed. They\\'re legitimately waking up, it\\'s not a dream. Waking up and being paralyzed, and it is terrifying. I\\'ve had this happen before. It is I can tell you terrifying to be wide awake, and as far as I could tell fully conscious, but unable to move. And then generally you can jolt yourself out of it in a few seconds, but it is quite frightening. Now some people actually experience waking up, being fully paralyzed and hallucinating. And there is a theory in the academic and scientific community at least, that what people report as alien abductions have a certain number of core characteristics that map quite closely, yearly similarly to these experiences. A lot of reports of alien abduction involve people being unable to move, seeing particular faces, hallucinating, extensively feeling like their body is floating, or they were transported. This is very similar to the experience of invasion of atonia into the waking state, waking up and still being paralyzed. As well as the hallucinations that are characteristic of dreaming and REM sleep. Now I\\'m not saying that people\\'s alien abductions were not legitimate alien abductions, how could I, I wasn\\'t there. And if I was there I wouldn\\'t tell you \\'cause that would make me an alien, and I wouldn\\'t want you to know. But it is quite possible that people are experiencing these things and they are an invasion of the sleep state into the waking state and they can last several minutes or longer. And because in dreams, space and time are distorted, our perception of these events could be that they lasted many hours and we can really feel as if they lasted many hours, when in fact they took only moments. And we\\'re gonna return to distortion of space and time in a little bit. So to just recap we\\'ve gone so far. Slow wave sleep early in the night. It\\'s been shown to be important for motor learning and for detailed learning. REM sleep has a certain dream component when which there\\'s no epinephrin, therefore we can\\'t experience anxiety, we are paralyzed. Those dreams tend to be really vivid and have a lot of detail to them. And yet in REM sleep what\\'s very clear is that the sorts of learning that happened in REM sleep are not motor events. It\\'s more about unlearning of emotional events. And now we know why, because the chemicals available for really feeling those emotions are not present. Now that has very important implications. So let\\'s address those implications from two sides. First of all we should ask, what happens if we don\\'t get enough REM sleep? And a scenario that happens a lot where people don\\'t get enough REM sleep is the following. I\\'ll just explain the one that I\\'m familiar with \\'cause it happens to me a lot, although I figured out ways to adjust. I go to sleep around 10:30, 11:00, I fall asleep very easily and then I wake up around 3:00 or 4:00 AM. I now know to use a NSDR, a non sleep deep rest protocol and that allows me to fall back asleep. Even though it\\'s called non sleep depressed it\\'s really allows me to relax my body and brain, and I tend to fall back asleep and sleep till about 7:00 AM. During which time I get a lot of REM sleep. And I know this because I\\'ve measured it, and I know this because my dreams tend to be very intense of the sort that we know is typical of REM sleep. In this scenario, I\\'ve gotten my slow wave sleep early in the night and I\\'ve got my REM sleep toward morning. However, there are times when I don\\'t go back to sleep, maybe I have a flight to catch, that\\'s happened. Sometimes I\\'ve got a lot on my mind and I don\\'t go back to sleep. I can tell you, and you\\'ve probably experienced that the lack of REM sleep tends to make people emotionally irritable. It tends to make us feel as if the little things are the big things. So it\\'s very clear from laboratory studies where people have been deprived selectively of REM sleep, that our emotionality tends to get a little bit unhinged and we tend to catastrophize small things. We tend to feel like the world is really daunting, we\\'re never gonna move forward in the ways that we want. We can\\'t unlearn the emotional components of whatever it is that has been happening, even if it\\'s not traumatic. The other thing that happens in REM sleep is a replay of certain types of spatial information about where we were and why we were in those places. And this maps to some beautiful data and studies that were initiated by a guy named Matt Wilson at MIT years ago. Showing that in rodents and it turns out in other non-human primates and in humans there\\'s a replay of spacial information during REM sleep, that almost precisely maps to the activity that we experienced during the day as we move from one place to another. So here\\'s a common world scenario, you go to a new place, you navigate through that city or that environment, this place doesn\\'t have to be, you know, at the scale of a city. It can be a new building. It could be finding particular rooms, new social interaction. You experience that and if it\\'s important enough, that becomes solidified a few days later and you won\\'t forget it. If it\\'s unimportant, you\\'ll probably forget it. During REM sleep there\\'s a literal replay of the exact firing of the neurons that occurred while you were navigating that same city you\\'re building earlier. So REM sleep seems to be involved in the generation of this detailed spatial information. But, what is it that\\'s actually happening in REM sleep? So there\\'s this uncoupling of emotion, but most of all what\\'s happening in REM sleep is that we\\'re forming a relationship with particular rules or algorithms. We\\'re starting to figure out based on all the experience that we had during the day, whether or not it\\'s important that we avoid certain people or that we approach certain people, whether or not it\\'s important that, you know, when we enter a building that we go into the elevator and turn left where the bathroom is, for instance. These general themes of things and locations and how they fit together and that has a word it\\'s called meaning. During our day we\\'re experiencing all sorts of things. Meaning is how we each individually piece together the relevance of one thing to the next, right? So if I suddenly told you that, you know, this pen was downloading all the information to my brain that was important to deliver this information, you\\'d probably think I was a pretty strange character. Because typically we don\\'t think of pens as downloading information into brains. But if I told you that I was getting information from my computer that was allowing me to say things to you, you\\'d say, \"Well, that\\'s perfectly reasonable.\" And that\\'s because we have a clear and agreed upon association with computers and information and memory, and we don\\'t have that same association with pens. You might say, \"Well, duh.\" But something in our brain needs to solidify those relationships and make sure that the certain relationships don\\'t exist. And it appears that REM sleep is important for that, because when you deprive yourself or people of REM they start seeing odd associations, they tend to lump or batch things. I know this from my own experience of I\\'ve ever been sleep deprived, which unfortunately happens too often because I\\'m terrible with deadlines, pull an all-nighter, the word the starts to look like it\\'s spelled incorrectly. And the is a very simple word to spell, but things start to look a little distorted. And we know that if people are deprived of REM sleep for very long periods of time, they start hallucinating. They literally start seeing relationships and movement of objects that isn\\'t happening. And so REM sleep is really where we establish the emotional load, but where we also, start discarding of all the meanings that are irrelevant. And if you think about emotionality, a lot of over emotionality or catastrophizing 34:10 Adults Acting Like Children is about seeing problems everywhere. And you could imagine why that might occur if you start linking the web of your experience too extensively. It\\'s very important in order to have healthy, emotional, and cognitive functioning that we have fairly narrow channels between individual things. If we see something on the news that\\'s very troubling, well, then it makes sense to be very troubled. But if we\\'re troubled by everything and we start just saying, you know, \"Everything is bothering me and I\\'m feeling highly irritable and everything is just distorting and troubling me.\" Chances are we are not actively removing the meaning, the connectivity between life experiences as well as we could and that almost always maps back to a deficit in REM sleep. So REM sleep is powerful and has this amazing capacity to eliminate the meanings that don\\'t matter. It\\'s not that it exacerbates the meanings that do matter, but it eliminates the meanings that don\\'t matter. And that bears a striking resemblance to what happens early in development. This isn\\'t a discussion about early in development, but early in development the reason a baby can\\'t generate coordinated movements, and the reason why children can get very emotional about what seems like trivial events, or what adults know to be trivial events. Like, \"Oh, the ice cream shop is closed.\" And then the kid just dissolves into, you know, a puddle of tears and the parents say, \"Okay, well, it\\'ll be open again in another time.\" The children one of the reasons that they can\\'t generate coordinated movement, or place that of the ice cream shop being closed into a larger context, is because they have too much connectivity. And much of the maturation of the brain and nervous system that brings us to the point of being emotionally stable, reasonable, rational human beings is about elimination of connections between things. So REM sleep seems to be where we uncouple the potential for emotionality between various experiences. And that brings us to the absolutely fundamental relationship and similarity of REM sleep to some of the clinical practices that have been designed to eliminate emotionality and help people move through trauma and other troubling experiences, whether or not those troubling experiences are a death in the family of a close loved one, something terrible that happened to you or somebody else, or, you know, an entire childhood or some event that in your mind and body is felt as and experienced as, bad, terrible, or concerning. Many of you perhaps have heard of trauma treatment such as EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing, or ketamine treatment for trauma. Something that recently became legal and is in fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough, EMDR and ketamine at kind of a core level, bear very similar features to REM sleep. So let\\'s talk about EMDR first. EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing is something that was developed by a psychologist, Francine Shapiro. She actually was in Palo Alto. And the story goes that she was walking, not so incidentally, in the trees and forest behind Stanford, and she was recalling a troubling event in her own mind. So this would be from her own life. And she realized that as she was walking, the emotional load of that experience was not as intense or severe. She extrapolated from that experience of walking and not feeling as stressed about the stressful event to a practice that she put into work in with her clients, with her patients, and that now has become fairly widespread. It\\'s actually one of the few behavior treatments that are approved by the American Psychological Association for the treatment of trauma. what she had her clients and patients do was move their eyes from side to side while recounting some traumatic or troubling event. Now this was of course in the clinic. And I\\'m guessing that she removed the walking component and just took the eye movement component to the clinic because while it would be nice to go on therapy sessions with your therapist and take walks there are certain boundaries to that such as, confidentiality. You know, if there are a lot of people around a person might not feel as open to discussing things, or weather barriers and things like that, you know, if it\\'s raining or hailing outside, it gets tough to do. Why eye movements? Well, she never really said why eye movements. But, soon I\\'ll tell you why the decision to select these lateralized eye movements for the work in the clinic was the right one. So these eye movements, they look silly. I\\'ll do them because that\\'s why I\\'m here. They look silly, but they basically involve sitting in a chair and moving one\\'s eyes from side to side, not while talking. But, you know, for it\\'s... And then recounting the events. So it\\'s sometimes talking while moving the eyes, but usually it was moving the eyes from side to side for 30, 60 seconds, then describing this challenging procedure. Now as a vision scientist who also works on stress when I first heard this, I thought it was crazy, frankly. People would ask me about EMDR and I just thought, \"That\\'s crazy.\" I went and looked up some of the theories about why EMDR might work and there were a bunch of theories. \"Oh, it mimics the eye movements during REM sleep.\" That was one. It turns out that\\'s not true and I\\'ll explain why. The other one was, \"Oh, it synchronizes the activity on the two sides of the brain.\" Well, sort of, I mean, when you look into both sides of the binocular visual field you activate the visual cortex. But, this whole idea of synchrony between the two sides of the brain is something that I think modern neuroscience is starting to, let\\'s just say, gently or not so gently move away from. This whole right brain, left brain business. It turns out however, that eye movements are the sort that I just did and that Francine Shapiro took from this walk experience and brought to her clients in the clinic, are the sorts of eye movements that you generate whenever you\\'re moving through space, when you are self-generating that movement. So not so much when you\\'re driving a car, but certainly if you were riding a bicycle, or you were walking or you were running, you don\\'t realize it but you have these reflexive subconscious eye movements that go from side to side, and they are associated with the motor system. So when you move forward your eyes go like this. There\\'ve been a number of studies showing that these lateralized eye movements helped people move through or dissociate the emotional experience of particular traumas with those experiences, such that they could recall those experiences after the treatment and not feel stressed about them, or they didn\\'t report them as traumatic any longer. Now the success rate wasn\\'t 100%, but they were statistically significant in a number of studies. And yet there are still some critics of EMDR. And frankly, for a long time I still thought, \"Well, I don\\'t know. This just seems like kind of a hack.\" It just seems like kind of something that for which we don\\'t know the mechanism, and we can\\'t explain, But in the last five years, there have been no fewer than five and there\\'s a sixth on the way, high quality peer reviewed manuscripts published in Journal of Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell Press Journal, Excellent Journal, Nature Excellent Journal. These are very stringent journals and papers showing that lateralized eye movements of the sort that I just did, and if you\\'re just listening to this it\\'s just moving the eyes from side to side with eyes open. That those eye movements but not vertical eye movements suppress the activity of the amygdala, which is this brain region that is involved in threat detection, stress, anxiety, and fear. There are some forms of fear that are not amygdala dependent, but the amygdala it\\'s not a fear center, but it is critical for the fear response and for the experience of anxiety. So that\\'s interesting. We\\'ve got a clinical tool now that indeed shows a lot of success in a good number of people, where eye movements from side to side are suppressing the amygdala. And the general theme is to use those eye movements to suppress the fear response, and then to recount or repeat the experience and over time uncouple the heavy emotional load, the sadness, the depression, the anxiety, the fear from whatever it was that happened that was traumatic. This is important to understand because, you know, I\\'d love to be able to tell somebody who had a traumatic experience that they would forget that experience, but the truth is you never forget the traumatic experience. What you do is you remove the emotional load. Eventually it really does lose its potency. The emotional potency is alleviated. Now EMDR I should just mention, tends to be most successful for single event or very specific kinds of trauma that happened over and over, as opposed to say an entire childhood or an entire divorce. It tends to be most effective for single event kinds of things, car crashes, et cetera, where people can really recall the events in quite a lot of detail. So it\\'s not for everybody and it should be done... If it\\'s going to be done for trauma it should be done in a clinical setting with somebody who\\'s certified to do this. But that bears a lot of resemblance to REM sleep, right? This experience in our sleep where our eyes are moving, excuse me, although in a different way, but we don\\'t have the chemical epinephrine in order to generate the fear response, and yet we\\'re remembering the event from the previous day or days. Sometimes in REM sleep we think about things happened a long time ago. So that\\'s interesting. And then now there\\'s this new treatment, this chemical treatment with the drug ketamine, which also bears a lot of resemblance to the sorts of things that happen in REM sleep. Ketamine is getting a lot of attention now. And I think a lot of people just don\\'t realize what ketamine is. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic. It is remarkably similar to the drug called PCP, which is certainly a hazardous drug for people to use. Ketamine and PCP both function to disrupt the activity of a particular receptor in the brain called the NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. This is a receptor that\\'s in the surface of neurons or on the surface of neurons for which most of the time it\\'s not active, but when something very extreme happens and there\\'s a lot of activity in the neural pathway that impinges on that receptor, it opens and it allows the entry of molecules, ions that trigger a cellular process that we call long-term potentiation. And long-term potentiation translates to a change in connectivity so that later you don\\'t need that intense event for the neuron to become active again. Let me clarify a little bit of this. The NMDA receptor is gated by intense experience. One way you could think about this is, typically I walk in my home, I might make some food and sit down at my kitchen table, and I don\\'t think anything about explosions. But were I to come home one night, sit down to a bowl of chicken soup and there was a massive explosion the neurons are associated with chicken soup in my kitchen table would be active in a way that was different than they were previously, and will be coupled to this experience of explosions such that the next time, and perhaps every other time that I go to sit down at the kitchen table, no matter how rational I am about the origins of that explosion, maybe it was a gas truck that was down the road and there\\'s no reason to think it\\'s there today, but I would have the same experience. Those neurons will become active and I\\'d get an increase in heart rate. I\\'d get an increase in sweating, et cetera. Ketamine blocks this NMDA receptor and prevents that crossover and the addition of meaning to the kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me, chicken soup explosion experience. So how is ketamine being used? Ketamine is being used to prevent learning of emotions very soon after trauma. So ketamine is being stocked in a number of different emergency rooms, where if people are brought in quickly and, you know, these are hard to describe even but, you know, a horrible experience of somebody seeing a loved one next to them killed in a car accident and they were driving that car. This isn\\'t for everybody, certainly and you need to talk to your physician, but ketamine is being used so they might infuse somebody with ketamine so that their emotion it can still occur, but that the plasticity, the change in the wiring of their brain won\\'t allow that intense emotion to be attached to the experience. Now immediately you can imagine the sort of ethical implications of this, right? Because certain emotions need to be coupled to experiences. I\\'m not saying that people should be using ketamine, or shouldn\\'t be using ketamine, certainly not recreationally it\\'s quite dangerous. It can be lethal and like PCP it can cause pretty dramatic changes in perception and behavior. But in the clinical setting the basis of ketamine assisted therapies is really to remove emotion. And I think the way I\\'ve been hearing about it talked about in the general public is a lot of people think it\\'s a little bit more like the kind of psilocybin trials or the NMDA trials, where it\\'s about becoming more emotional or getting in touch with a certain experience. Ketamine is about becoming dissociative or removed from the emotional component of experience. So now we have ketamine, which chemically blocks plasticity and prevents the connection between an emotion and an experience. That\\'s a pharmacologic intervention. We have EMDR, which is this eye movement thing that is designed to suppress the amygdala, and it\\'s designed to remove emotionality while somebody recounts an experience. And we have REM sleep, where the chemical epinephrin that allows for signaling of intense emotion and the experience of a tense emotion in the brain and body is not allowed. So we\\'re starting to see a organizational logic, which is that a certain component of our sleeping life is acting like therapy. And that\\'s really what REM sleep is about. So we should really think about REM sleep and slow wave sleep as both critical. Slow wave sleep for motor learning and detailed learning. REM sleep for attaching of emotions to particular experiences. And then for making sure that the emotions are not attached to the wrong experiences and for unlearning emotional responses if they\\'re too intense or severe. And this all speaks to the great importance of mastering one sleep, something that we talked about in episode two of the podcast. And making sure that if life has disruptive events, either due to travel or stress, or changes in school hours or food schedule, something that we talked about in episodes three and four, that one can still grab a hold and manage one sleep life. Because fundamentally the unlearning of emotions that are troubling to us is what allows us to move forward in life. And indeed the REM deprivation studies show that people become hyperemotional. They start to catastrophize. And it\\'s no surprise therefore, that sleep disturbances correlate with so many emotional and psychological disturbances. By now it should just be obvious why that will be the case. In fact, the other day I was in a discussion with a colleague of mine who\\'s down in Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. I\\'ve known her for two decades now from the time she was at Oxford. And Sarah studies among other things menopause in the brain. And she was saying that a lot of the emotional effects of menopause, actually are not directly related to the hormones. There\\'ve been some really nice studies showing that the disruptions in temperature regulation in menopause mapped to changes in sleep regulation that then impact emotionality and an inability to correctly adjust the circuits related to emotionality. And I encourage you to look at her work. We\\'ll probably have her as a guest on the podcast at some point in the future, \\'cause she\\'s so knowledgeable about those sorts of issues, as well as issues related to testosterone and in people with all sorts of different chromosomal backgrounds. So sleep deprivation isn\\'t just deprivation of energy. It\\'s not just deprivation of immune function. It is deprivation of self-induced therapy every time we go to sleep. Okay. So things like EMDR and ketamine therapies are in-clinic therapies, but REM sleep is the one that you\\'re giving yourself every night when you go to sleep. Which raises, I think, the other important question which is, how to get and how to know if you\\'re getting the appropriate amount of REM sleep and slow wave sleep. So that\\'s what we\\'ll talk about next. So how should one go about getting the appropriate amount of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep and knowing that you\\'re getting the right amount. Well, short of hooking yourself up to an EEG, it\\'s gonna be tough to get exact measurements of brain states from night to night. Some people nowadays are using things like, the Oura Ring or a WHOOP band, or some other device to measure the quality and depth and duration of their sleep. And for many people those devices can be quite useful. Some people are only gauging their sleep by way of whether or not they feel rested, whether or not they feel like they\\'re learning and they\\'re getting better or not. There are some things that one can really do. And the first one might surprise you in light of everything I\\'ve said, and probably everything you\\'ve heard about sleep. There was a study done by a Harvard undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, who was in Robert Stickgold\\'s lab at the time. And that\\'s the study explored how variations in total sleep time related to learning, as compared to total sleep time itself. And to summarize the study, what they found was that it was more important to have a regular amount of sleep each night as opposed to the total duration. 53:15 Sleep Consistency In other words, and what they showed was that improvements in learning or deficits in learning were more related to whether or not you got six hours, six hours, five hours, six hours, that was better than if somebody got for instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven hours, four or five hours. See you might say, \"Well, that\\'s crazy because I thought we were just all supposed to get more sleep and there\\'s more REM towards morning.\" It turns out that forsake of learning new information and performance on exams in particular, that\\'s what was measured, limiting the variation in the amount of your sleep is at least as important and perhaps more important than just getting more sleep overall. And I think this will bring people great relief, many people great relief who are struggling to \"get enough sleep.\" Remember, a few episodes ago I talked about the difference between fatigue and insomnia. You know, fatigue tends to be when we are tired. Insomnia tends to lead to a sleepiness during the day when we\\'re falling asleep. And you don\\'t want that, you don\\'t want either of those things really. But, I found it striking that the data from this study really point to the fact that consistently getting about the same amount of sleep is better than just getting more sleep. And I think nowadays so many people are just aiming for more sleep, and they\\'re rather troubled about the fact that they\\'re only getting five hours, or they\\'re only getting six hours in some cases. It may be the case that they are sleep deprived and they need more sleep, but some people just have a lower sleep need. And I find great relief, personally, in the fact that consistently getting, for me, about six hours or six and a half hours is going to be more beneficial than constantly striving for eight or nine and finding that some nights I\\'m getting five and sometimes I\\'m getting nine and varying around the mean. As I recall, and I think I\\'m gonna get this precisely right, but if not I know that I\\'m at least close. For every hour variation in sleep regardless of whether or not it was more sleep than one typically got, there was a 17% reduction in performance on this particular exam type. So this is powerful. This means that we should strive for a regular amount of sleep. And for some of us that means falling asleep and waking up and going back to sleep. For some people means falling asleep and waking up and not getting back to sleep. Now ideally, you\\'re getting the full compliment of slow wave sleep early at night and sleep toward morning, which is REM sleep. Which brings us to, how to get more REM sleep. Well, there are a couple of different ways but here\\'s how to not get more REM sleep. All right. First of all, drink a lot of fluid right before going to sleep. One of the reasons why we wake up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom is because when our bladder is full there is a neural connection, literally a set of neurons and a nerve circuit that goes to the brain stem that wakes us up. Actually some people that I know and won\\'t be mentioned, actually use this to try and adjust for their jet lag when they\\'re trying to stay awake. Having to urinate is one of the most anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. If you really have to go to the bathroom it\\'s very hard to fall asleep or stay asleep. And bedwetting, which happens in kids very early on is a failure of those circuits to mature until, you know, I think we all assume that babies are gonna pee in their sleep, but adults aren\\'t supposed to do that. And the circuits take some time to develop and in some kids they develop a little bit later than others. So having a full bladder is one way to disrupt your sleep. You don\\'t wanna go to bed dehydrated, but that\\'s one way. On the other hand there is evidence that if you want to remember your dreams more, or remember more of your dreams there is a tool that you can use. I don\\'t necessarily recommend it, which is to drink a bunch of water before you go to sleep. And then what happens is you tend to break in and out of REM sleep. It tends to be fractured. And with a sleep journal and they\\'ve done these laboratory studies. Believe it or not, people will recall more of their dreams because they\\'re in this kind of semi-conscious state because they\\'re constantly waking up throughout the night. I suggest not having a full bladder before you go to sleep. That one\\'s kind of an obvious one, but nonetheless. The other one is if you recall that during REM sleep we have a shift in neurotransmitter such that we have less serotonin, right? Just wanna make sure I got that right. Excuse me, less serotonin. There are a lot of supplements out there geared toward improving sleep. I\\'ve taken some of them and I\\'ve taken many of them, if not all of them at this point. So I could report back to you. And I think I mentioned on a previous episode that when I take tryptophan, or anything that contains 5-HTP, which is serotonin or a precursor to serotonin, serotonin is made from tryptophan, I tend to fall very deeply asleep and then wake up a few hours later. And that makes sense now based on the fact that, you just don\\'t want a lot of REM sleep early on. What was probably happening is that I was getting a lot of REM sleep early on, because low levels of serotonin are typically associated with slow wave sleep and that comes early in the night. So for some people those supplements might work, but be aware serotonin supplements could disrupt the timing of REM sleep and slow wave sleep. And in my case led to waking up very shortly after going to sleep and not being able to get back to sleep. Now if you want to increase your slow wave sleep. That\\'s interesting. There are ways to do that. One of the most powerful ways to increase slow wave sleep, the percentage of slow wave sleep, apparently without any disruption to the other components of sleep and learning is to engage in resistance exercise. It\\'s pretty clear that resistance exercise triggers a number of metabolic and endocrine pathways that lend themselves to release of growth hormone, which happens early in the night. And resistance exercise therefore can induce a greater percentage of slow wave sleep. It doesn\\'t have to be done very close to going to bed time. In fact, for some people the exercise could be disruptive, for reasons I\\'ve talked about in previous episodes. But resistance exercise, unlike aerobic exercise does seem to increase the amount of slow wave sleep, which as we know is involved in motor learning and the acquisition of fine detailed information not general rules, or the emotional components of experiences. For those of you that are interested in lucid dreaming and would like to increase the amount of lucid dreaming that you\\'re experiencing, I haven\\'t been able to track down that device with the red light that I described at the beginning, but there are a number of just simple zero technology tools that one could use in principle. One is to set a queue. The way this works is you come up with a simple statement about something that you\\'d like to see, or experience later in dreams. You can, for instance, write down, you know, something like, I want to remember the red apple. I know it sounds silly and trivial, and you look at that you would probably wanna write it down on a piece of paper. You might even want to draw a red apple, and then before you go to sleep you would look at it and then you would just go to sleep. There are some reports that doing that for several days in a row can lead to a situation in which you are suddenly in your dream and you remember the red apple, and that gives you a sort of tether to reality between the dream state and reality that allows you to navigate and shape and kind of adjust your dreams. Lucid dreaming does not have to be, or include the ability to alter features of the dream, you know, to be able to control things in the dream. Sometimes it\\'s just the awareness that you are dreaming, but nonetheless some people enjoy lucid dreaming. And then for people that have a lot of lucid dreams that feel kind of overwhelmed by those, that\\'s going to involve trying to embrace protocols that can set the right duration of sleep. There\\'s a little bit of literature not a lot that shows that keeping the total amount of sleep per night to say six hours such that you begin sleep and end at the beginning and end of one of these ultradian cycles, can be better than waking up in the middle of one of these ultradian cycles. So try and find the right amount of sleep that you need, that\\'s right for you, and then try and get that consistently night to night. If you\\'re a lucid dreamer and you don\\'t like it, then you may want to start to make sure that you\\'re waking up at the end of one of these ultradian cycles. So in this case, it would be better to wake up after six hours than after seven and if you did sleep longer than six hours, maybe you\\'d wanna get to seven and a half hours. \\'Cause that\\'s gonna reflect the end of one of these 90 minute cycles, as opposed to waking up in the middle. Alcohol. Alcohol and marijuana are well known to induce states that are pseudo sleep like. Especially, when people fall asleep after having consumed alcohol or THC, one of the active components of marijuana. Alcohol, THC and most things like them, meaning things that increase serotonin, or GABA are going to disrupt the pattern of sleep. They\\'re going to disrupt the depth. They\\'re going to disrupt the overall sequencing of more slow wave sleep early in the night and more REM sleep later in the night. That\\'s just the reality. There are some things that at least, in a few studies that I could find seem to suggest that you could increase the amount of slow wave sleep using things like arginine, the amino acid arginine. Although, you really wanna check. Arginine can have effects on heart, et cetera has other effects. But, alcohol, THC, not gonna be great for sleep and depth of sleep. You might feel like you can fall asleep faster, but the sleep that you\\'re accessing really isn\\'t the kind of deep restorative sleep that you should be getting. Now, of course, if that\\'s what you need in order to sleep and that\\'s within your protocols, I\\'ve said here before, I\\'m not suggesting people take anything. I\\'m not a medical doctor. I\\'m not a cop. So I\\'m not trying to irregulate anyone\\'s behavior. I\\'m just telling you what the literature says. Some of you may want to explore your dreams and meaning of dreams, et cetera. You know, there\\'s not a lot of hard data about how to do this, but a lot of people report keeping a sleep journal, where a dream journal can be very useful. So they mark when they think they fell asleep the night before, when they woke up and if they wake up in the middle of the night, early in the morning they\\'ll just write down what they can recall of their dreams. And even if they recall nothing, many people have the experience of mid morning or later afternoon that suddenly comes to them that they had a dream about something and writing that down. I kept a dream journal for a while. It didn\\'t really afford me much. I didn\\'t really learn anything except that my dreams were very bizarre. But, there are some things that happen in dreams that are associated with REM sleep as compared to slow wave sleep, which can tell you whether or not your dream likely happened in REM sleep or slow wave sleep. And the distinguishing feature it turns out is something called theory of mind. Theory of mind is actually an idea that was developed for the study and assessment of autism. And it was initially that phrase, theory of mind, was brought about by Simon Baron Cohen, who is Sacha Baron Cohen, the comedians brother. Simon Baron Cohen is a psychologist and to some extent an neuroscientist at Oxford. And theory of mind tests are done on children. And the theory of mind test is some what like the following, a child is brought into a laboratory and watches a video of a child playing with some sort of toy. And then at the end of playing with that toy they put the toy in a drawer and they go away, and then another child comes in and is looking around and then the experimenter asks the child who\\'s in the experiment, the real child and says, \"You know, what does the child think? You know, what are they feeling?\" And most children have a particular age, five or six or older will say, \"Oh, you know, he or she is confused, they don\\'t know where the toy is.\" Or, they\\'ll say something that implies what we call theory of mind, that they can put their ideas and their mind into what the other child is likely to be feeling or experiencing. That\\'s theory of mind. And it turns out that this is used as one of the assessments for autism, because some children, not all, but some children that have autism or that go on to develop autism don\\'t have this theory of mind. They tend to fixate on the fact that the first child put the toy in the drawer. They\\'ll say it\\'s in the drawer as opposed to answering the question which is how does the second child feel about it, or what are they experiencing? So theory of mind is something that emerges early in life as a part of the maturation of the circuits in the brain associated with emotional learning and social interactions. And we experienced this in certain dreams. So if you had a dream that you\\'re puzzled about, or that you\\'re fixated on and you\\'re thinking about, you might ask, \"In that dream was I assessing somebody else\\'s emotion and feeling, or was I very much in my own first person experience?\" And that the tendency is that theory of mind tends to show up most in these REM associated dreams. Now this isn\\'t a hard and fast rule, but chances are if you were in a dream and you were thinking about other people who wanted to do something to you, you were thinking about their desire to chase you or help you, or something that was related to someone else\\'s emotional experience. It was probably a REM dream. That dream occurred in rapid eye movement sleep as opposed to slow wave sleep. And that makes sense when you think about the role of REM in emotional unlearning of associations with particular life events. That REM is rich with all sorts of exploration of the emotional load of being chased, or the emotional load of having to take an exam the next day, or being late for something. But again, if you\\'re fixated or you can recall thinking a lot about, or feeling a lot about what somebody else\\'s motivations were then chances are it was in REM and if not chances are it was in slow wave sleep. Today we\\'ve been in a deep dive of sleep and dreaming, learning and unlearning. And I just want to recap a few of the highlights and important points. A lot more slow wave sleep and less REM early in the night, more REM and less slow wave sleep later in the night. REM sleep is associated with intense experiences without this chemical epinephrine that allows us the anxiety or fear. And almost certainly has an important role in uncoupling of emotion from experiences. Kind of self-induced therapy that we go into each night. That bears striking resemblance to things like EMDR and ketamine therapies and so forth. Slow wave sleep is critical, however, it\\'s critical mostly for motor learning and the learning of specific details. So REM is kind of emotions and general themes and meaning, and slow wave sleep, motor learning and details. I personally find it fascinating that consistency of sleep, meaning getting six hours every night is better than getting ten one night, eight the next, five the next, four the next. I find that fascinating and I think I also like it because it\\'s something I can control better than just trying to sleep more, which I think I\\'m not alone and agreeing that that\\'s just hard for a lot of people to do. This episode also brings us to the conclusion of a five episode streak where we\\'ve been focusing on sleep and transitions in and out of sleep, non sleep depressed. We\\'ve talked about a lot of tools, morning light, evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers, supplements, tools for measuring sleep duration and quality. We\\'ve been covering a lot of themes. I like to think that by now you\\'re armed with a number of tools and information. Things like knowing when your temperature minimum is, knowing when you might wanna view light or not, when you might wanna eat or take hot showers, or God forbid a cold shower, something that most people including me more or less loath, but can have certain benefits. And that will allow you to shape your sleep life and get this consistent, or more or less consistent amount of sleep on a regular basis. Nobody\\'s perfect. In fact I have this little joke that I sometimes tell, it\\'s not funny. Like, most of the jokes I tell I\\'m told are not funny, but, you know, there\\'s so much excitement now about intermittent fasting. Sometimes I think that someone should start something on intermittent sleep deprivation, although we\\'re already doing that. We are all experiencing lack of sleep from time to time. And I don\\'t think we should catastrophize that too much. I think that what we wanna do rather than accumulate a sleep anxiety is to... You know, if we get a bad night\\'s sleep, we want to adjust, we want to get back on track and just get the consistent amount of sleep. Use those non sleep deep rest protocols to help us relax when we\\'re feeling anxious, we\\'re having trouble waking up in the middle of the night. There are a lot of tools out there, and most of them are zero cost. And so I hope you\\'ll find those beneficial. If you\\'ve been hearing Costello snoring throughout this episode. I apologize in his behalf. As I said, in the welcome video to this podcast he\\'s an integral part of the podcast. A few people have said, \"Hey, that noise in the background is really disruptive.\" Hey, what can I say? Costello is a ten- year-old bulldog mastiff. The lifespan on those animals is about 10 years. So I\\'m not trying to make you feel guilty, but, you know, after he\\'s gone there won\\'t be any snoring, although I\\'ll probably get a different dog. So sort of a, what were the kids say, sorry not sorry. Sorry not sorry about the snoring and I\\'m sorry if it\\'s disruptive genuinely, but he\\'s here for the hall. So that\\'s what that\\'s about. As we close out the segment on sleep we are moving into a new theme and topic for the next four to five episodes. We are going to discuss the science and the tools related to neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is a remarkable feature of the nervous system. In fact, it\\'s the defining feature of the nervous system, which is its ability to change itself in response to experience. That is unlike every other tissue and collection of cells and organ in our body. It\\'s really what makes us us as a species and it\\'s what makes us us as individuals, and it\\'s really where our potential lies. Everything that we know, everything we can do, and our true potential in terms of what we will ever be able to know, do, say, in life is set by the limits of neuroplasticity. So we\\'re going to explore learning and childhood, learning and adulthood. We\\'re going to discuss detailed protocols as they relate to sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus motor plasticity or sensory motor integration. We\\'re going to talk about language acquisition. We\\'re going to be talking about emotional acquisition and breadth. As well as, I think a topic a lot of people are gonna find fascinating is, the relationship between plasticity set during childhood attachment to parent or other caregiver, and how that maps onto adult relationships. Many of you have probably heard about secure attach or insecure attach. The A, B and C, D babies as they\\'re called from the classic studies of Bowlby and others. But now there\\'s actual neuroscience that can say which circuits were active during those early life attachment and how those map to adult attachment styles, challenges, and what makes us more likely to select certain partners and styles of attachment, as well as how to change those. It\\'s really fascinating and I think neuroscience\\'s time has come for neuroplasticity. We\\'re also gonna talk, of course, about supplements and chemicals and machines and devices that can assist in speeding up the plasticity process. Or believe it or not, there are some cases where you might want to delay plasticity in order to get more depth of learning and have that learning last longer. Something that is just absolutely spectacular literature. So I\\'m very excited to move on to that topic soon. I hope that the tools that you\\'ve acquired so far and the knowledge that you\\'ve acquired so far is helping you with your self evaluation and experimentation as you see fit, and is allowing you to not just sleep better, but feel better while you\\'re awake. And hopefully has set the stage for you to learn better as we start to march into the month on neuroplasticity. Many of you have asked how you can help support the Huberman Lab Podcast and we greatly appreciate the question. You can help support the podcast by subscribing to the YouTube channel, if you haven\\'t already and leaving comments and questions in the comment section. If you could subscribe on Apple and or Spotify, that\\'s helpful. And there\\'s a place on Apple Podcasts to leave a rating, as well as comments about how you feel about the podcast. If you could suggest the podcast to friends and coworkers and anyone else that you think would benefit from the information that also really helps us get the word out. And of course, check out our sponsors because that\\'s a very direct way to help us continue to get this information out to the general public. Many of you have asked about supplements and where I personally get my supplements. I\\'ve partnered with Thorne and I get my supplements from Thorne because, by my view they have the highest level of stringency and precision in terms of what\\'s in the bottle. And they also have very high quality standards. They\\'re partnered with the Mayo Clinic and all the major sports organizations. If you wanna try Thorne supplements you can go to thorne.com. So that\\'s Thorne spelled thorne.com/u/huberman. And if you do that you can see the formulations that I take. And you\\'ll also get 20% off, not just those formulations, but anything that Thorne makes. That\\'s thorne.com/u/huberman to get 20% off anything that they provide. Last but not least, a few people wrote to me with some questions/corrections about things that I said in previous podcasts. So in keeping with my goal of making the information accurate and clear, I just want to correct myself about a few things that I said. One of those and I\\'m guessing it probably came from an endocrinologist or somebody else that knows a lot about testicles said, \"Huberman, you mentioned that testosterone is made by the sertoli cells of the testes, and it\\'s not. It\\'s made by the leydig cells of the testes.\" And indeed you are correct. And so I want to make sure that I clarify that. Testosterone is made by the leydig cells of the testes, not by the sertoli cells. The sertoli cells make 5 alpha-reductase and aromatase, and some other enzymes involved in conversion of testosterone into things like DHT and estrogen. So thank you for that correction. I genuinely appreciate it. I misspoke. The other thing I said, was at one point I said, \"Typical temperature is 96.8 when I actually meant to say 98.6.\" So it was a dyslexic slip on my part and I apologize. I don\\'t know that I\\'m dyslexic. I know I haven\\'t been clinically diagnosed with dyslexia, but I swapped them, which sometimes happens when I\\'m going fast. So I apologize. I\\'ll use this a moment to just say temperature varies a lot across the day and night, that was a theme of previous podcasts. So we can\\'t really talk about average temperature anyway, but I do want to be clear that most people think about average temperature as 98.6. I misspoke, my error and I apologize. Thank you for joining me in this journey of the nervous system in biology and trying to understand the mechanisms that make us who we are and how we function in sleep and in wakefulness. It\\'s really an incredible landscape to consider and I hope that you\\'re getting a lot out of the information.

Today my guest is Dr Gina Poe, Dr Gina Poe is a professor in the department of Integrative biology and Physiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. Her laboratory and research focuses on the relationship between sleep and learning, in particular how specific patterns of brain activity that are present during specific phases of sleep impact, our ability to learn and remember specific types of information, for instance, procedural information. That is how to perform specific cognitive or physical tasks, as well as encoding of emotional memories and discarding emotional memories. Indeed, her research focuses on how specific phases of sleep can act as its own form of trauma therapy discarding the emotional tones of memories. In addition, her laboratory focuses on how specific phases of sleep impact things like the release of growth, hormone growth, hormone, of course, plays critical roles in metabolism and tissue repair, including brain tissue repair, and therefore has critical roles in vitality and Longevity. Today you will learn many things about the relationship between sleep learning, emotionality and growth hormone, one basic, but very important, takeaway. That you'll learn about today, which was news to me, is that it’s not just the duration and depth of your sleep that matter, but actually getting to sleep at relatively the same time. Each night ensures that you get adequate growth hormone release in the first hours of sleep. In fact, if you require, let's say eight hours of sleep per night, but you go to sleep two hours later than your typical bedtime On Any Given night. You actually miss the window for growth hormone release. That’s right! Getting growth hormone release in sleep, which is absolutely critical to our immediate and long-term health, is not a prerequisite of getting sleep even if we are getting enough sleep as Dr Poe explains their critical brain circuit and endocrine. That is hormone circuits that regulate not just the duration and depth and quality and timing of sleep. But when we place our bout of sleep, that is when we go to sleep each night, plus or minus about a half hour or so strongly dictates whether or not we will experience all the health promoting including mind promoting benefits of sleep. Today’s episode covers that and a lot more in substantial detail. You will learn, for instance, how to use sleep in order to optimize learning, as well as forgetting for those things that you would like to forget. So during today’s episode, Dr Gina Poe shares critical information about not just Neuroscience but physiology and the hormone systems of the brain and body that strongly inform mental health, physical health and performance. So, by the end of today’s episode, you'll be far more informed about sleep and how it works. The different roles it performs and you'll have several new actionable steps that You can take in order to improve your mental health, physical health and performance before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today’s podcast. Our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink. That has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of salt, magnesium and potassium, the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar. The electrolytes are critical to the function of every cell. In your body, in particular, the neurons, the nerve cells as I've talked about before on this podcast neurons nerve cells require adequate, sodium and potassium, as well as magnesium, in order to fire Action potentials, which are the electrical signals that allow neurons to do. Everything from generate focus and attention allow you to learn and generate neuromuscular connection and allow you to exercise or train or do any kind of skilled activity with a high degree of output. I take element about two or three times per day, typically once in the morning and again after or during my bout of exercise each day and sometimes an additional one. If I've sat in a hot sauna and sweat a lot or if the weather is very hot, if you'd like to try element, you can go to drink element. That’s lmnt.com, Huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that’s drink element, lmnt.com Huberman, to claim a free sample pack. Today’s episode is also brought To Us by Helix sleep. Helix. Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are the absolute highest quality. Now sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health and performance. When we are sleeping well all of those things Excel and when we are not sleeping well, all of those things suffer now the surface that you sleep on. That is the mattress that you sleep on is critical and Helix understands that everybody has slightly different sleep needs. So if you were to go to the Helix site, which I invite you to do and take their brief two minute quiz, it will match your body type and sleep preferences to the perfect mattress for you. It will ask you questions. For instance, do you sleep on your back or your side or your stomach? Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night, or maybe you don't know the answers to those questions? I went and took the Sleep quiz at Helix and it matched me to the so-called dusk mattress dusk. I started sleeping on Dust mattress over a year ago and it’s the best sleep that I've ever had. It’s completely transformed the depth and duration and quality of my sleep in ways that make me feel far better during the daytime. If you're interested in upgrading your mattress, you can go to helixsleep.com Huberman, take their two-minute sleep, quiz and they'll match you to a customized, mattress and you'll, get up to 350 off any mattress order and two free pillows again, if interested go to Helix sleep.com Huberman for Up to 350 off and two free pillows, today’s episode is also brought To Us by eight sleep. Eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity. Now again, sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health and performance, but what many people don't realize is that, in order to fall and stay asleep, your core body temperature has to drop by about one to three degrees. Conversely, in order to wake up each morning and feel refreshed your body, temperature actually has to increase by one to three degrees. Therefore, controlling the temperature of your sleeping environment is absolutely key with eight sleep, that’s very easy to do depending on whether or not you typically run too cold or too hot during the night you can program your eight Sleep mattress cover so that it’s the optimal temperature, Not just for you, but for each phase, the early middle and late phase of your sleep and for waking up in the morning. In fact, you can even control the temperature of your eight Sleep. Mattress cover differentially across the mattress, if you're sleeping alongside somebody else, if you'd like to try eight sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com Huberman and check out their pod Pro cover and save 150 at checkout.

The Huberman Lab podcast is now partnered with momentous supplements to find the supplements we discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast. You can go to live, momentous spelled ous live momentous.com Huberman. I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly Expanding again, that’s livemomentous.com Huberman and now for my discussion with Dr Gina Poe, Dr Gino Poe, welcome. Thank you. I'Ve really been looking forward to this conversation because I'm familiar with your work - and I know that many people are going to be excited to learn about your work as it relates to sleep as it relates to problem solving creativity, addiction and craving relapse. And a number of other important topics so to start things off, I would love for you to educate us a bit about this thing that we are all familiar with, and yet very few of us understand, which is sleep and if you would could you describe the Various phases of sleep that exist, what distinguish them and perhaps frame this within the context of what would a perfect night's sleep? Look like okay? How long would it last more or less, and what would the biology look like what? What is a perfect night's sleep? Oh yeah, that’s a great question all right, so sleep is really different from wakefulness and, in fact, can't be replaced by any state of wakefulness that we've been able to come up with so far. Our brain chemistry is completely different and in the different stages of sleep which there are is non-rem and REM are the two major states of sleep and every animal we've studied so far seems to have both of those States anyway. Those two states are entirely different from one another too, and even within non-rem. There are three states stage, one which is what you slip into when you first falling asleep. It’s dozing, there's kind of an interesting Rhythm that goes on in the brain. It’s kind of a fast gamma Rhythm and then there's stage two, which is a really cool State. We sort of used to ignore sleep researchers because it was a transient State between wakefulness and the Deep stage, three slow way, sleep, which is the most impressively different and then, and between that and REM, sleep. So stage two I'll talk a little bit more about and then the Deep slow way sleep state, which is when big, slow waves sweep through our brain, and now we realize that it cleans our brain. One of the things that those big slow waves do is cleans. Our brain and does other really important things to restore us um from a day of wakefulness and then REM, sleep which is the most popular because that’s where we have the most active dreams and um. When you wake up someone out of REM, sleep they'll almost always report having dreams. Something really bizarre. That’s called REM, sleep, rapid eye movement, sleep, so those are the four states of sleep of human sleep and we cycle through them every 90 minutes or so when we go to sleep, say: 10. 10, 30. 11 o'clock, our first REM, sleep period, comes about a hundred and five minutes after we fall asleep and lasts about 20 minutes. Actually, it comes about 95 minutes and last 10 or 15 minutes, and then we start over again and we have about five of those per night for a perfect night's sleep, four or five. Something like that. So A Perfect night's sleep is seven and a half eight hours. There was a really great study that put people in a semi- darkened room with nothing, but the bed for 12 hours every day for a month, and what people did initially is because, because we're in a sleep, deprived nation, is that they slept a lot more than usual. Like 10 or 11 hours of the 12, and then they leveled off after a week or two to about eight hours and 15 minutes of sleep, so you actually can't oversleep. I mean they had nothing else to do butt sleep and they would round off to on average, eight hours and 15 minutes a night and then to spend the rest of the Time twiddling their thumbs, humming Tunes, interesting daydreaming. I want to get back to the Contour of a perfect night's sleep, but I'm intrigued by this idea that people can't oversleep I'm often asked whether or not we can get too much sleep and whether or not sleeping too long long excuse me can make us groggy. The next day is there anything to that um and how does one determine how long they should sleep right on average on average yeah? Well, that’s interesting because different people need seem to need different amounts of sleep, but we don't really even know exactly what sleep is for. So what they need is you know kind of it’s it’s. You know Mercury murky um, so we do know a lot of things that sleep does now for us, but we don't know how long those things take. So how long we need to sleep is also just a big question mark, but some people don't feel rested until they've slept nine hours and some people don't feel rested after three or four and a half, but most people if they consistently deprive themselves of sleep so That they're only sleeping four four and a half hours a night build up a cognitive deficit that just builds up over time. The more nights you have with sleep deprivation, the more cognitive deficit you have, and so you need sleep again to sleep more to recover. Now the question you had about um: can you over? Can you oversleep right? Can you sleep to the point where it’s too much? You know that we I growing up um when I was in high school. My girlfriend's dad had this belief that no one should sleep in past 6 a.m, so he would wake all the there were two children in that home. He would wake up the kids in that house. He had to sing Against over sleeping regardless of when people went, went to sleep, and I always thought that was um, an interesting mentality, yeah um, that’s not terrible. Actually, because what that will do is it'll put you make you sleepier the next night to get to bed on time, so it'll build up your homeostatic need if you wake up too early but um, so I don't think you can oversleep, but people who sleep a Lot like people who sleep over nine hours, it’s probably indicative of some other problem, because, in fact, if you have a lot of different conditions, it will cause you to sleep a lot more, probably because what it does is it interferes with your efficient sleep. The efficiency of your sleep, so if you find yourself sleep being consistently nine hours plus every night, then you might want to consult a doctor about maybe what else it might be. It could be cancer, it could be sleep apnea that just affects a lot of people. It could be that your sleep is super inefficient because you're snoring a lot more than you know or you're waking up a lot more than you know every night. So you might want to sleep study just to see how your sleep is and then see what else might be, causing you to sleep so much, and that wouldn't be. If somebody is sleeping nine or ten hours. You know every once in a while. You mean, if they're, consistently sleeping for more than nine hours, they feel like they need it in order to function cognitively the next day. It might be that your sleep is just not efficient and you might want to look into why that that’s the case interesting. Forgive me for the anecdote, but I can't resist years ago I went to an acupuncturist and um. He gave me these red pills, of which I don't know what they contain uh-oh, but I took them because he told me they would help with my sleep and I would fall asleep about 30 minutes after taking them, and I would have incred incredibly excuse me vivid Dreams and I'd wake up four or five hours after having gone to sleep feeling completely rested something that I've never really experienced interesting on a consistent basis. I want to do mass spec on these pills. I still have no idea what was in them whatsoever exactly some people have thought that perhaps they had GHB gamma hydroxybutyrate, which is by the way, an illegal drug. It can kill you, it’s not a, not something you want to take um but anyway, if, if ever someone can figure out what the red pills were I'll be very um, and this is not a red pill of the of the other sort red pill. This is just the red sleep pills. Interesting, I mean it could have been even a placebo effect, because Placebo is extremely strong. So, although I I don't know, there was really something to these red pills So shout out to the acupuncturists and uh and the Eastern medicine um, but to return this I to this idea of the architecture of a perfect night's sleep. So you said um, we fall asleep. The first 90 minutes of sleep REM, sleep, rapid eye movement. Sleep will arrive at about 95 minutes in. Does that mean that the rest of that 90 minutes is consumed with slow wave sleep, yeah, non-rem, sleep, okay, and what about the Sleep where we are lightly asleep? And we might have a dream that has us somehow thinking about movement or that we jolt ourselves away, because that often happens early in the night. Yeah yeah. That’s the first stage stage, one and stage two of sleep and stage: two sleep is really cool, because that has something called sleep, spindles and K complexes and what sleep spindles are are a little bit of activity. That’s 10 to 15 Hertz in frequency. It’s a conversation between the thalamus and the cortex, so the thalamus is the gateway to Consciousness and the neocortex. You know, processes all our cognition and um. So it’s it’s. These spindles they're called sleep spindles and if you wake up out of that state, you will often report a dream like a hallucination style dream. It won't be a long dream report like you, have out of REM sleep, but it will be some hallucination state enduring. While we're falling asleep one of the reasons we call it falling asleep is because in stage one and stage two our muscles are relaxing and if there's part of our brain, that’s conscious enough to sort of recognize that relaxation will feel like we're falling and will jerk Awake so often that hallucination, it’s called hypnagotic hallucination will feel like it'll include some falling aspect that will wake up out of that’s really interesting to me. I'Ve long felt that sensation of almost like dropping back into my head um, so much so that if I elevate my feet just slightly and I tilt my head back just slightly in order to go to sleep, I find that I fall asleep much faster interesting, but It does feel as if I'm going to fall, like almost gon na, do a backward somersault. I actually really like the the sensation and usually because it proceeds falling deeply yeah. That’s really interesting. I'M somebody has to do a study of elevated feet and yeah. There'S a little bit on um body position and sleep and some of the washout that we'll talk about so early in the night um. You got these lighter stages of sleep, less rapid eye movement, sleep. What can we say about the dreams that occur during the say? First and second um, you know 90 minute cycles of sleep. Are they quite different than the patterns of sleep and dreaming that occur later in the night or toward morning? Well, okay, that’s an interesting question. There'S a lot of facets to it. There is some evidence that the first four hours of sleep are very important for memory processing and in fact, if you've learned something new that day or have experienced a new sensory motor experience, then your early sleep dreams will incorporate that experience. Much more than the later sleep dreams later, as that memory gets Consolidated from the early structures, which are the hippocampus deep in the temporal lobe to the cortex in a distributed fashion. That memory seems to move from that hippocampus to the cortex and also the dreams that incorporate that memory also move later in the night. So nobody knows why, but it does. There was a great study by siddarta Ribeiro who studied the consolidation of memories from the cortex from the hippocampus to the cortex in a rat across the period of a full day. Sleep because rats sleep in the daytime and he found that each subsequent Rim sleep period, moved that memory, a from the hippocampus to the first first area, that projects to it and then the second area. And then the third area. And you can see the memory moving Um through the throughout the Sleep cool period, yeah very cool, so you have to read that study. So um there's a number of different hormones associated with the different stages of sleep. We know that melatonin is a hormone of nighttime of nighttime. That makes a sleepy um what about growth hormone release when does that occur during sleep, so growth hormone release happens all day, long and all night long, but the Deep, slow way sleep that you get. The very first sleep cycle is when you get a big bolus of growth, hormone release and in men and women equally, and if you miss that first deep, slow way sleep period, you also miss that big bolus of growth hormone release and you might get ultimately across The day, just as much overall growth hormone release, but endocrinologists will tell you that big boluses do different things than a little bit eeked out over time. So that is well. We know, there's also a big push to synthesize proteins. So that’s when the protein synthesis part that builds memories, for example in our brain, happens in that first cycle of sleep. So you don't want to miss that, especially if you've learned something really big and needs needs more synaptic space to encode it. How would somebody miss that first 90 minutes driving themselves yeah? So so let's say I normally go to sleep at 10 pm and then from 10 to 11 30 would be this first phase of sleep and that’s when the growth hormone, big bolus of growth hormone would be released. Does that mean that if I go to sleep instead at 11, 30 or midnight that I miss that first phase of sleep, why is it not the case that I get that first phase of sleep just simply starting later? It is a beautiful clock that we have in our body. That knows when things should happen, and it’s every cell in our body has a clock and all those clocks are normally synchronized and the Circadian clocks are synchronized, and so our cells are ready to respond onto that growth hormone release at a particular time, and if we Miss it and it’s a time in relation to melatonin also so if you miss it yeah you might get some growth hormone release, but it’s occurring at a time when that your clock has already moved to the next phase, and so it’s it’s just a clock thing. Yeah, I don't think we can overstate the importance of what you just described and to be honest, despite knowing a bit about the Sleep, research and circadian biology. This is the very first time that I've ever heard this that if you normally go to sleep at a particular time and growth hormone is released in that first phase of sleep that you can't simply initiate your sleep bout later and expect to capture that first phase Of sleep yeah, that’s incredible and I think important and um, as many listeners are probably realizing, also highly actionable. So what this means is that we should have fairly consistent bedtimes in addition to fairly consistent, wait times. Is that right exactly and in fact one of the Best markers of good neurological health when we get older, is consistent, bedtimes, wow, okay, um. I don't want to backtrack, but I did write down something that I think is important for me to resolve or for you to resolve. So I'm going to ask this um people that sleep, nine hours or more perhaps that reflecting an issue. Some underlying issue, perhaps is being a teenager or an adolescent and undergoing a stage of of development where there's a lot of bodily and brain growth. In exception to that, because, yes, I don't recall sleeping a ton when I was a teenager, I had a ton of energy, but I know a few teenagers and they sleep a lot yeah like they'll, just sleep and sleep and sleep and sleep: should we let them Sleep and sleep and sleep okay, I can sleep okay, so that’s the one exception. What about just like babies? Okay, when you're developing something in your brain or the rest of your body. You really need sleep to help. Organize that I mean sleep is doing really hard work in organizing our brains and and making it develop right, and if we deprive ourselves of sleep we will actually also just I like, like. I said we have a daily clock. We also have a developmental clock and we can miss a developmental window if we don't let ourselves sleep extra like we need to what other things inhibit: growth, hormone release or other components of this first stage of sleep. In other words, if I go to sleep religiously, every night at 10 pm are there things that I perhaps do in the preceding hours or the preceding day like ingest, caffeine or alcohol, that can make that first stage of sleep less effective. Even if I'm going to sleep at the same time, alcohol definitely will do that because alcohol is a REM, sleep suppressant and it even suppresses some of that stage. Two transition to REM with those sleep spindles and those sleep spindles. We didn't talk about their function yet, but they're really important for moving memories to our cortex. It’s a unique time when our hippocampus, the sort of like the ram of our brains, writes it to a hard disk and which is the cortex and there it’s a unique time when they're connected. So if you don't want to miss that you don't want to miss REM sleep when is also a part of the consolidation process and schema changing process and alcohol in there. You know before before we go to sleep, we'll do that until we've metabolized alcohol and put it out of our bodies, it will affect our sleep badly, so probably fair to say no ingestion of alcohol within the four to six hours preceding sleep, given the half-life or At all, or at all would be better, but I know some people refuse to go that way and maybe a little bit is okay. I don't know what the dose response is, but um there are studies out there. You can look at great yeah, so we're still in the first stage of sleep and I apologize for slowing us down. But it sounds like it’s an Incredibly important first phase of sleep. What about the second and third 90 minute blocks of sleep? Is there anything that makes those um unique? What is their signature uh besides the fact that they come second and third in the night, there's more and more REM sleep? The later the night we get um there's also a change in hormones. You know the growth hormone and melatonin levels are starting to decline, but other hormones are picking up. So it is a really different stage that you also don't want to shortchange yourself on and I think that’s the stage. Many studies are showing that those are the times in sleep when the most creativity can happen. That’s when our dreams can incorporate and put together old and new things together into a new way and um and our schema are built during that time. So um yeah. We can change our minds best during those phases of sleep. Could you elaborate a little bit more on schema? No one, I don't think anyone on this podcast has ever discussed. Schema I'm a little bit familiar with schema from my courses on psychology, but it’s been a while. So maybe you could just refresh your mind and everyone. Well, it’s it’s still a concept right, I think of schema as um like we have a schema of Christmas right. We we have all kinds of ideas that we sew together and call Christmas a holiday season in the northern hemisphere. It’s cold. We have Santa Claus and reindeer and jingle bells, and even things that are false, that that we normally associate with Christmas presents family gathering when it is all of this stuff is sewn together until one there's a thread linking them all, and we can just give ourselves A list of words and um and none of them contain the word Christmas and then ask people later um, you know, give them another list of words and include the word Christmas and they'll say: oh yeah. That word was there because in their minds they brought up that word Christmas, because it’s part of that whole schema. So that’s what it’s sort of a related, a lot of related Concepts. I guess when I think about it, sort of like on the desktop of my computer um would scare some people, but it’s just a ton of folders yeah, but each of the folder names means something very clear and specific to me. Right and inside of those folders are collections of things that make sense in terms of how they're batched is that kind of one way, exactly? No that’s a great way to think of it and and when you're in REM sleep in the later parts of the night and that transition to REM, that’s when your computer of your brain is opening folders and comparing documents. Seeing, if is there anything the same? These two documents look very much the same, but there's a little bit of difference and it can. It can link those conceptually so that that’s probably one of the origins of creativity is finding things that are related, maybe just linked a little bit, and you can find that link and strengthen it. If it, you know, makes your schema interesting and different, very interesting. Um. Many people, including myself, tend to wake up, maybe once during the middle of the night to use the restroom, I've tried to drink less fluid before going to sleep I've. I'Ve heard also that um the impulse to urinate - I forgive the topic, but a lot of people deal with this, so the impulse to urinate is also dictated by how quickly you drink fluid, not just the total volume. So I've switched to sipping fluids more slowly. For my last beverage of the day, which seems to help, but the point here is that I think a lot of people wake up once in the middle of the night oftentimes to use the restroom but oftentimes just around 3 A.M and might be up for a Few minutes, hopefully not on their phone or viewing any Bright Light, which can cause more wakefulness but then go back to sleep. Is there any known detriment to this middle of the night waking or should we consider it a normal feature for some people's sleep architecture? I think we shouldn't worry about it. Actually, I think you know sleep is really incredibly well homeostatically regulated and so really don't worry about how much you're sleeping as long as you're, not intentionally depriving yourself of sleep by doing something really rewarding and exciting, because even that is stressful to your body and deprives You a lot of things we're talking about, so don't worry about it, um, it’s absolutely normal to wake up, at least once in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and as long as you can get back to sleep in a reasonable amount of Time, um, you know, or even if it takes you an hour, don't worry about it as long as you have a lifestyle that allows you to then make up that sleep either the next morning or the next night or going to bed a little earlier. So if I understand correctly, there's a little bit of asymmetry to sleep that catching that first phase of sleep, it’s like you either get it or you don't, and you have to get it by going to sleep essentially the same time each night, maybe plus or minus 15 minutes or so yeah, but then, if I wake up in the middle of the night and go back to sleep, I cannot catch up, but I can gather all the sleep that I would have gotten had. I just slept the whole way through the night. Is that right, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah and, and we don't know actually the answer to whether or not the sleep in the middle between that early sleep and the late sleep is in fact different for another reason, and whether depriving yourself of sleep from say one to 2 30 in the morning is bad in a different way. We don't know well, I suppose I am the experiment in that case, because I do tend to wake up once per night and I've sort of come to recognize it as part of my normal sleep architecture, I don't obsess over it. I do notice that when I go back to sleep and especially toward mourning that my sleep Is incredibly deep, my dreams are incredibly Vivid. I don't always remember them, but what is unique, perhaps about the architecture of dreams and sleep in the let's say the last third of the night or this or the second half of the night right yeah. The second half of the night, we have longer REM, sleep periods and those are considered the deepest sleep. Even though slow wave sleep, big, slow wave is considered deep. It is deep yeah, they call slow, wave sleep, deep sleep and REM sleep rapid I mean, but now you're telling me that REM sleep is actually the deeper sleep. Okay, there needs to be a new nomenclature, sleep, researchers! No, no, please. The reason why you cause slow wave sleep deep sleep is because it’s difficult to arouse people out of that state and when you do arouse them out of that state, they are most often confused and just want to go back into sleep and can go back pretty Easily, if you arouse someone out of REM, sleep they're more likely to report something that was really kind of almost like wakefulness. It was so vivid, but in fact, if you give someone and none threatening kind of stimulation, like somebody dropping keys or a ping, or something like that, instead of waking that same volume will wake someone up out of non- rim sleep, but out of REM, sleeping instead lengthen The amount of time or make it even more dense and your rapid eye movements more dense and often people will incorporate that sound into their dreams. So the body and brain are somehow conscious of the um of the sound, and I've heard also smells can even make it into our dreams and REM sleep, but that we it doesn't arouse us. It doesn't arouse us as often yeah interesting, and maybe one of the reasons why REM sleep is deeper is especially in adults and older people that deep slow wave sleep goes away. So it’s not as deep. It’s not as big the slow waves aren't as large, which is probably problematic, but we're not sure, and so then REM sleep. It becomes the deepest stage actually in children, it’s kind of a toss-up because they it’s really hard to wake them up. Out of that deep, slow wave sleep and in fact fire alarms, don't wake them up even really loud fire alarms out of that state of sleep. So that’s why they're trying to change fire alarms so that, instead of something that the kids don't associate with anything like whatever they don't associate when it says their name or something else that may be less loud but more Salient to them and will wake them up. I don't know having carried sleeping children in from the car. I don't know that I want children to start waking up from sleep, because that’s one of the best things when you get home and the kids are asleep in the back seat. You can literally throw them over your shoulder gently of course, yes and put them to sleep in, and they are completely out yeah completely wonderful it is wonderful one of Nature's gifts I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking athletic greens since 2000 and 12 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast the reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be the probiotics that I need for gut health our gut is very important it’s populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes great if you'd like to try athletic greens you can go to athleticgreens.com Huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road in the car on the plane Etc and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin d3k2 again that’s athleticreens.com Huberman 00:34:37 Later Sleep, Paralysis, Sleepwalking, Sleep Talking To get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2. So this enhanced volume or or proportion of rapid eye movement sleep in the second half of the night relates to more elaborate dreams. We are paralyzed during REM, sleep, correct! Yes, normally it’s paralyzed and that’s really good, because that’s the time when we're actively dreaming storyline dreams and we could hurt ourselves - we're actually really cut off from the outside world. In terms of you know, responding to say this table or a window or a door, and so different from sleepwalking, which is out of slow wave sleep out of slowly sleep. That sleepwalking is a mixture between sleep and wakefulness, so you actually will respond to the door. You can cook a full meal, drive your car, while you're in deep slowly sleep, it’s scary, because you never know what you're going to do. You don't have voluntary voluntary control over it. You have no conscious control over it, but you can actually safely navigate some situations in sleepwalking and actually have a conversation, although it may not make much sense when you're sleep talking in REM, sleep you're, not processing the outside world and instead, when you're acting out your Dreams, you could be doing things like walking through a plate, glass window or falling off of you know down the stairs things like that. So you really want your muscles to be inactivated during REM, sleep. Otherwise, you will act out those dreams and really hurt yourself or your bed partner. What about sleep talking or talking in sleep um? I don't know how many relationships have um been saved by sleep talking, but I'm guessing a few have been destroyed and I'm guessing that um talking in sleep could have meaning or perhaps has no meaning just as dreams could have meaning or no meaning, as we recall Them yeah do not take sleep talking seriously, no matter what people say, it doesn't necessarily reflect truth, so it’s not like you're being more truthful when you're sleep talking, you just saved a number of relationships. Um, I'm not directing this to anyone in particular, but I I guarantee you just Did um noted um so as people start to approach mourning or the time when they normally would wake up, I've heard that it’s important to, if possible, complete one of these 90-minute Cycles prior to waking up. That is, if you set your alarm for halfway through one of these 90 minute cycles that come late in the night of sleep, that it can lead to um rather groggy patterns of waking um. So I'll just ask you directly: do you use a an alarm clock? I do not um, thankfully I'm in a line of work that doesn't require me normally to do anything at any particular time. I'D do it when I do it unless I have to catch a plane, and then I always set my alarm just in case well. As a fellow academic, I can tell you. There are plenty of punishing features about being an academic scientist that um that offset the fact that you don't have to use an alarm clock, but it is nice that you can often set your own schedule. So would you recommend that, if possible, that people not use an alarm clock yeah? Absolutely if you can just listen to your body and wake up when you need to wake up? That would be great um but um. One of the reasons why we have such a grogginess is called Sleep inertia when we wake up out of the wrong state, which is um deep, slow wave. Sleep is because I liken it to uh like a washing machine cycle. This 90-minute Cycles, like a washing machine cycle and and um the first part, is to add water right and then your clothes are soaking wet. You don't want to open the washing machine and try and function put them on and wear them around, while they're soaking, wet and full of soap. So you have to wait until the cycle is through before you can well. Actually, let's put it in the dryer too, before you want to wear them so yeah you can function. It just takes a little while for those clothes that brain to dry out, so you can actually function well, um, but it’s better to wait through the whole cycle. Is complete and so that’s why you want to set that 90 90 minute alarm clock and again that’s around 90 minutes, because the first stage of sleep, the first cycle of sleep, is actually a little longer more like 105 110 minutes, but then the second ones and Third ones they get sort of shorter and shorter, as the night goes on and in the last few Cycles, you're just doing the N2 REM sleep cycle, which takes less time, and if you wake up out of REM, sleep there's usually no problem. Cognitively you're good to go. Are you a fan of of sleep, trackers, uh sure, yeah yeah? Do you use one I have one on? I don't take. I don't. I don't live my life by them because they are the best ones. Right now are about 70 effective at staging your sleep, so 70, it’s okay, it’s okay, but um. Take it with a grain of salt is what I'm saying. Yeah I've tried various ones, and I compare the mattress based one to a. I actually wear it on my ankle instead of my wrist but um and I do find it informative, but a um, a colleague of mine at Stanford Ali Crum, who works on mindset and belief, effects. Um talk to me about a study they did where people often will buy us their sense of daytime wakefulness based on their sleep score more than their subjective score. In other words, if they were told they got a poor night's sleep, even if they got a great night's sleep in the in - and this was of course measured in the sleep lab. So they they're able to compare people report feeling more groggy and the opposite is also true that if it says 100 or 90 on your sleep score, then people go, I feel great, even though they might not have slept well. So this speaks to the. I don't want to say placebo effect, but the sort of belief effects that are woven in with a score yeah um. So so it seems to me that combining subjective and objective data is probably better, and I do believe that you should trust your own physiology and the way that your body is telling you to feel, because in fact, it used to be that people with insomnia weren't Were often not believed because you put them in a sleep lab and they look like they slept great and you wake them up in the morning they say. Oh, I didn't sleep very well at all, and that’s because probably we we just came out with a paper that shows that subcortical structures can be in a completely different sleep State than cortical structures, which is what we measure in the sleep lab. What the cortex is doing so it might be that people who say I did not sleep all night long, even though the cortex is saying. Oh no, you had great sleep was because they're they're monitoring their subcortical hypothalamus hippocampus Thalamus other other structures that the sleep lab. Just can't access, unless you have depth electrodes, which nobody really wants right, because that requires holes in the skulls and wires yeah wow. So, does that mean that the last 50 plus years of sleep science um it’s potentially flawed in some way, because they're only recording from I guess this would be. The analogy would be it’s like recording from the surface of the ocean as opposed to the depth of the ocean right and trying to ascertain the life moving down deep in there, brace yourselves uh colleagues at Stanford, sleep lab and elsewhere uh. But please just tell us, because I think scientists want to know the truth, yeah yeah, for nothing that you you want to know what the cortex is doing. I mean the cortex is really important for a lot of things, but it doesn't necessarily tell you what a lot of other really important parts of the brain are doing in terms of sleep and um, but there's hope because in fact it would be great. I think that’s possible from the paper. If you look at it, it’s in pnas this year that you could detect subtle changes in the cortical EEG. That might be able to tell you what the subcortical structures are doing. Things like the absolute power in that sleep, spindle band, that Sigma band would change if the hippocampus is in REM, sleep and the cortex is in that sleep, spindle, State and and vice versa. So there is some hope that we can gain from people with depth, electrodes or animals with depth electrodes that we could backwards machine, learn what the cortex might be able to tell us about subcritical structures from the cortical EEG so interesting. This is going to be a stimuli. Yeah stay tuned. It’s going to be a stimulus for development of new Technology which is always going to assist in scientific discovery, um there's one more thing. I wanted to ask about the architecture of the night's sleep um in terms of early part of the night. Earlier you mentioned the washout of debris and um the so-called lymphatic system. I think is what you're referring to. Could you tell us a little bit more about the washout that occurs in the brain during sleep? What what that is and what roles it’s thought to serve and perhaps if there are any ways to ensure that it happens or to ensure that it doesn't happen, and obviously we want this to happen. Yeah yeah um all right great question. We talked about the circadian clock and how certain things happen at certain times. Well, one of the things that happens when we're awake and talking to each other is that there's a lot of plasticity, there's something that I'm learning from you today and you're learning from me and that changes our synapses and it changes the way our proteins are going To be folded and and changed during sleep, it unfolds, this process actually uses a lot of ATP the power um structure, the fuel of the brain and it unfolds also proteins, while we're doing this while we're using them, and so during that, first part of the night. When we first fall asleep in the first 20 minutes or so we're building that adenosine back into ATP, and that’s probably why power naps are called Power naps because we're actually rebuilding the power and then we're also cleaning out through the Deep slow waves of slave sleep Cleaning out all those misfolded proteins unfolded, proteins and other things that get broken down and you know need to be rebuilt when we're asleep because of its use during wakefulness. So I liken that too. You know having a big party during wakefulness and you need all those partygoers to leave in order to do the cleanup, and so what I think the mechanism is - and this is still something to be tested - is actually slow waves themselves, which is bad news for us. As we get older and those slow waves get smaller and uh slowly, sleep goes away so um. So what happens when a neuron is firing? Is that it expands? The membrane expands a little bit becomes more translucent. That’s how we know one of the ways. We know that neurons expand when they fire and so every action potential the membrane expands a little bit as sodium brings water into the cell and then when they're silent, they contract and so in during slow waves. The cool thing is that the reason why you can measure them is that all the neurons, at the same time, not all of them, but a good portion of them are firing at the same time and Silent at the same time, and so you think about that. As Contracting and expanding all at the same time, it’s kind of like a bilge pump of the brain so that can pump out glia, are also really important for this um in terms of cleaning up debris and transferring it to where it needs to go so um. So I think of it actually as a bilge pump cleaning out our brain, interesting. I'Ve heard about the glymphatic system and the lymphatic washout. I'Ve never thought about the mechanical aspects of it before. I always thought that for some reason that now it’s obvious to me, there had to be something mechanical, but only now that you've educated me about this. I thought that for some reason, the the cerebral spinal fluid just starts washing through, but here you're talking about literally an expansion and a contraction of the neurons in unison and pushing the fluid through cleaning out any misfolded proteins or debris that might occur. Yeah, on the basis of these metabolic pathways, and the consequence of that is to to what to leave the brain in a state of um, more pristine action for for the next day. Yeah is that right, yeah, you think of it again, like a party and if you don't clean up after that party, you try and hold another one. The next day it’s going to get more clogged. You know it’s people have a harder time, moving around and enjoying themselves, and if that builds up day after day, you know it’s going to be cognition. That would be the party goers moving around um becomes card yeah, and so this um builds pump that you describe is associated with the big slow waves of of um deep well of slow wave sleep yeah um. So this is going to occur more or less in the first third of the night. Is that right, that’s right and um? Are there things that inhibit this process and are there things that facilitate this process? Yeah yeah connected inhibit; it’s not to get it um, but right and here too uh. Sorry, it’s in trouble um, but - and is this similar to the case with growth hormone? Where, if you go to sleep later than you would normally you miss the washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay it. You miss, you missed the washer. That’s right! That’s right! So if you go to sleep at one or two in the morning, your sleep is still going to be dominated by N2 and REM. Sleep not by slow wave sleep. So you need to you need to get that first bit of sleep would a caveat, be if somebody normally goes to sleep at one or two a.m and wakes up at 10 A.M, that, if that’s their normal sleep cycle, yeah um, that should be okay. It should be okay, um, you would probably want to do. Somebody would want to do a sleep study with people who do that normally and see, if also the Melatonin releases later and the corticosterone rise. That happens normally in the morning also happens later. So if everything shifted good, um, okay, yeah, there are a few studies. I'Ve um come across that really do argue for the fact that waking up Circa Sunrise, that doesn't mean at Sunrise but within an hour or two, maybe three hours of sunrise and going to sleep within four hours after sunset or so um, is actually better for the Health of all human beings than is being a night out and the night owl there's almost like a night owl Posse out there, especially on social media. They get very upset when you say that you should see morning sunlight that after 10 a.m, you kind of miss the boat um. They get very upset because I think there are about 20 or 30 percent of people, perhaps who um, who really feel like they function? Better staying up late and waking up late and they function much less well waking up early and going to bed early, but the data on health metrics suggests that sorry night owls that they are wrong. Yeah. Sorry me because I'm a night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, I'm apologizing directly - and here I'm not a really early morning person, I'm kind of more typical if I wake up. Naturally, around 6 30 somewhere between 6 30 and 7 30 a.m, go to sleep somewhere between 10 and 11 p.m. These are averages um, but I do notice that when I force myself to get up a little earlier and go to sleep a little earlier, that my mood and alertness and just overall productivity is much higher and there could be other variables there too. Absolutely right. I'M a night owl I love staying up late at night. Doing you know, writing grants writing papers watching movies whatever it is. I love it, but I like you and like every human being on Earth, do better if I go to bed earlier and wake up earlier. So one good thing for night owls is to have a child because they will wake you up. Their circadian rhythms are so strong, they will wake up and even if you deprive them of sleep in the first half of the night, they will still wake up like clockwork because their circadian rhythms are so strong at 6am. And so what you've you haven't done. Anything good for your kid. You haven't moved their cycle to later and be more in line with yours. In fact, you've just sleep, deprived them and made them miss a window and made them cranky the next day and made your life more miserable, so go to bed soon after your kids go to bed and wake up with them. That’s the way to do it right. The child alarm clock another reason to have children. Yes, I got a dog a puppy and then that became a dog specifically well for many reasons. But one reason was: I wanted to be one of those early morning. Raj. You know 5 30 a.m every morning, but I ended up getting a bulldog that would literally sleep 16 hours. If he could, a nuclear bomb could go off and he wouldn't wake up. But what I started to learn was that Bulldogs actually have sleep apnea there. It’s a as far as I know, they're the only species that has a genetically um they're. Essentially, an inbred um sleep defect, yeah, and so I actually don't encourage people to get Bulldogs because it’s kind of a cruel breed. They suffer a lot in that body that they're born into anyway um a dog can accomplish some some of this, but get that get the uh the breed of dog that is going to wake up early, so, in other words, don't get a bulldog or a Mastiff. Well, you know, interestingly, all all um, predatory animals like dogs and cats, us um, well, more dogs, cats and lions than us. Wills can sleep. You know 16 hours a day, ferrets are predatory, they fight a pet ferret yeah and I sadly, I also used to work on ferrets, publish a number of papers, delightful animals, yeah and great, because you can study development, it’s really cool um, because they're born very alterial, Like we are with brains that are not very well developed, and so you can see what happens through development and how important these different phases of development really are. But yes, um yeah, maybe we're not as Predator as much Predators as we think, because in fact, we our sleep is somewhere between the prey and the Predators um in terms of the amount of sleep that we usually need a night. But those Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping all day, long and and they're more crepuscular, perhaps like their prey arm, so Dawn and dusk, active yeah, Don and dusk, active um yeah, but anyway, yes, uh children and dogs, actually in. If there was a poll done by the national sleep Foundation to see what the number one thing is, that wakes people up at night and number two is going to the bathroom number. Three is children because um, you know you're when your children are young, but that only lasts a few years that they'll wake you up when they're babies um. But the number one thing is: pets and pets needing to go out. Um or cats. Wanting to curl up with you or whatever it is Pets needs will wake you up more in the middle of the night than anything else. Another reason to not get a nocturnal pet people who get hamsters pretty quickly, realize that they are nocturnal and they want to run on their wheel around yeah. You got to put them in the living room away from where you sleep. I vote fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. There are all sorts of reasons to not get a saltwater tank, freshwater fish tank or a child um. I appreciate that vote and I appreciate you mentioning ferrets and by the way, folks they are carnivores. They are not rodents and they are. They have very elaborate brain structures and they're, very smart um in the same family as the honey badgers and the other musculates anyway. Well, I shouldn't uh geek out too much on On the mustolids, or else I'll, take the the remainder of all our time. I'D love for you to tell us about REM, sleep and the Sleep later in the night as it relates to dreams and emotionality, and this is probably um the appropriate time for you to introduce us to this incredible structure in the brain, which is the locus ceruleus. A difficult um structure to spell, but a beautiful, a beautifully named structure um I find Lucas release to be just fascinating and I know I you know a small fraction of what it does and I'm hoping you're going to educate me and and our audience about more About what it does and hopefully tell us a little bit about its relationship to epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, I'm so glad you brought this up because I can totally geek out on the locus or list. Please do Locus, meaning spot or place and serverless meaning blue. So you could just call it the blue spot. That’s the easiest. Every animal with a brain has a blue spot and um yeah, and I mean every other animal with the brain because of course, there are animals with nervous systems that are not centralized like jellyfish um, but anyway we're digressing there. So um, the locus to release is filled with neurons that have in them. Norepinephrine, which is the brain's version of epinephrine or adrenaline, is also called noradrenaline and what it does is it just like adrenaline and the rest of our bodies. It helps Primus to respond to our environment. So when Locus rulis, neurons, Fire and Fire in a burst, we can switch our attention and they will fire in a burst. If, for example, a loud noise happens in the middle of your concentrating on something, so you can it helps it fires and it helps you switch your attention to that thing and then learn quickly from it. So it’s really important in a stress response. It helps us. Do a quick one, trial, learning and and then a tonic activity during the day when you're, just you know doing normal, going about your normal concentration kind of activity activities is really good for sustained attention it. It works with the cholinergic system of our basal forebrain, which is really important for learning and memory also to help us learn about things and put things together, but just Tonica level levels are signature of wakefulness and alertness. So too much is panic with a local surrealist activity. A burst is switching attention and then tonic levels are sustained constant attention and then, when we go to sleep, the locus cerealis slows and goes from about on average two Hertz to about one Hertz one cycle per second tonically. And then when we go into REM sleep. It’s the only time when it shuts off completely, and it appears that that complete silence is really really important for a number of things, and the main thing that I think it’s important for is the ability to erase and break down synapses that are no longer working For us, so they encode things that are false now or they are encoding things that we learned in the novelty encoding Pathways of our of our brain that have now been Consolidated to other Pathways, and so we need to Now erase them from the novelty encoding pathway And that is really really important for being able to continue to learn things all of our lives so like erasing that REM um or that I don't know, what do you call those discs that you stick into computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing your Thumb drive so that thumb drive is what you carry around all day long and then during sleep. You write that thumb drive to the cortex to the long-term memory structures and you need to refresh that thumb drive and that’s what happens during REM sleep when the locus cerealis is off, because whenever it’s on and neurodrenaline is there, it helps us to put things together. It helps us to learn and strengthen synapses, but it does not allow us to actually weaken synapses that are also a really important part for Life. Important part of lifelong learning, um yeah, there's so much more. I could say about that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating, so it’s connected to the basal forebrain cholinergic system, um the neurons in Locust ceruleus. If I'm not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine as well uh um. Well, no, the brain's version of epinephrine is norepinephrine um. The other thing it also uh the precursor to norepinephrine is dopamine, and so the source of dopamine in the hippocampus seems to be the locus cereals and it’s still a mystery, is under what conditions. The Locust rules also releases dopamine, but it’s really important when we're learning something new to also release dopamine or to at least activate the dopaminergic receptors in our hippocampus, so yeah so dopamine norepinephrine and then there's also galanin, which is important for releasing when we're stressed and It helps also without rapid learning. It works in concert with norepinephrine and in doing what it needs to do to strengthen synapses so that we learn really quickly. I I love um that there are multiple molecules involved, because that signals us to a principle, which is that, even if people can't remember all the names um that rarely in biology is something handled by just one. Molecular pathway. That redundancy is the rule yeah, because signaling attention to specific events is so important so that I'm going to use that as a just so story. I always say you know I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but it makes sense to me as to why redundancy would exist in this system absolutely and in fact, when we form hypotheses about the brain, we're always wrong, and the reason why we're always wrong is Because it’s more complicated than we'd like to think and because in our brains, when we're forming hypotheses, it’s we fail to account for all of the factors that are involved. You know the glia, the neuropeptides, the neurotransmitters, the physical structure of synapses, and so when I was going through grad school 35 years ago, uh we, the Dogma, was that every neuron contains one neurotransmitter and releases one neurotransmitter and you had excitatory neurotransmitters and inhibitory neurotransmitters and Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters, but that’s as complicated as got and then we started talking about neuropeptides and people said: oh no, please don't don't complicate it and then we start talking about how neurons contain both neuropeptides and neurotransmitters and maybe more than one neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - and oh Lord - you know it’s just so complicated but got ta admit that’s why it works right and every time the brain teaches us something new about itself that we didn't hypothesize. We say. Oh, of course, is that wouldn't work. If the way I hypothesized it with it, you know we actually need redundancy. We need all these systems to work together, so it’s uh daunting sometimes, but it also ensures many many careers in science and Neuroscience in particular So um note that aspiring scientists there's plenty of room uh for Discovery. Do you want me to talk about norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, what I'd love? What I'd love for you to um tell us about! Is you know what role this lack of norepinephrine released during rapid eye movement? Sleep is thought to achieve, and maybe you could also review some of your work describing conditions under which norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye movements, sleep and other patterns of sleep and how that can be detrimental yeah. So a lot of this is hypothetical, but based on a lot of good evidence that we're sewing together into the schema from which these hypotheses come. So a model schema from which the hypotheses come. But one thing that happens to people with post-traumatic stress disorder is that there is a lot of evidence that the locus cerealis doesn't stop firing in REM sleep so, whereas their levels of norepinephrine might be similar to people without PTSD during the day and even during the First part of the night during the wee hours of the morning and when you measure norepinephrine levels from metabolites in the blood or the cerebral spinal fluid, you see that people with PTSD it’s during the wee hours of the morning when you have the most REM sleep That they have their neuropinephrine levels, differentiate most from those that don't have PTSD, and so that’s evidence that the locus reality is not shutting down during REM. Sleep like it should other evidence is heart rate variability. When our Locus realist is firing, our heart rates are generally a little higher and they don't vary as much as they do when the locusceralis is not firing. So during slow wave, sleep normally have this big juicy variability in heart rate, with every breath in and breath out, because our neurodenergie levels or norepinephrine levels are lower during REM, sleep that goes away entirely and our heart rate is, is um, is dominated by parasympathetic, rather Than sympathetic activity, and also what our brain is driving, you know what we're dreaming about. For example, if We're Dreaming we're running, our heart rates will go up, but norepinephrine levels still should be low or off so people with PTSD that neurodenergics we're studying these in rats too. Is it true that our Locus cells doesn't um shut off when we have post-traumatic stress disorder and the preliminary evidence is yes, it’s true that it doesn't shut off. So what that would do is norepinephrine would act at synapses to prevent that weakening that you really need, for example, of novelty, encoding structures, and it keeps memories in that novelty encoding structure, even once it’s Consolidated to the rest of the brain, so in the hippocampus, which Is important for remembering things throughout our lives and and it’s that thumb drive um, we we need it to be erased so that we can learn new things once it’s been Consolidated to the the hard drive of our cortex, and so, if we're not able to do That we fill up that Ram um really quickly or that thumb drive really quickly and we're not able to learn new things. So, for example, after a trauma I talked about the locus responding in stressful situations. That’s great it’s very adaptive, but then you need it to stop once you've learned what you need to learn from it and you want to go to sleep, you need the locus for Less to calm down and during REM, sleep. You want it to stop because then, when you've Consolidated that traumatic memory to the cortex, you need to erase it from the novelty encoding structures, for example in the hippocampus, so that then, when you're in the context of safety, you can learn those new things. Those new contexts and um and stop responding to those same stimuli as though you're in that original situation. So if you're not able to erase that thumb drive, you will always feel like that trauma happened that same day like earlier that same day and respond as you would to a an early, a recent trauma which is with beating heart and all of that, so even Memories that are years past, if you're never able to downscale that novelty encoding structure and you purge it from that traumatic memory. It will stay fresh and new and then become maladaptive I'd like to just take a brief moment and thank one of our podcast sponsors which is inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that blood work is the only way that you can monitor the markers such as hormone markers lipids metabolic factors Etc the impact your immediate and long-term Health one major challenge with blood work however is that most of the time it does not come back with any information about what to do in order to move the values for hormones metabolic factors lipids Etc into the ranges that you want with inside tracker changing those values becomes very straightforward because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use to address the nutrition-based behavior-based supplement-based approaches that you can use in order to move those values into the ranges that are optimal for you Your vitality and your longevity inside tracker now includes a measurement of APO lipoprotein B so-called APO B and they're all plan apob is a key marker of cardiovascular health and therefore there's extreme value to knowing your apob levels if you'd like to try inside tracker you can go to insidetracker.com Huberman to get 20 off any of inside Tracker'S plans again that’s inside tracker.com Huberman to get 20 off. What approaches are you aware of that? Can turn down the output of locus ceruleus during these phases of sleep and for that matter, what things can cause ramping up of locus cerules during this phase of sleep? We'Ve had a couple: podcast episodes, solo episodes and with guests talking about trauma, we had Dr Paul Conte who's. A Stanford train, Harvard train um psychiatrist, who talked a lot about trauma, wrote an excellent book on trauma and um. Certainly, sleep was emphasized as a key thing. Like get enough sleep, but here you're saying even if somebody with trauma gets enough sleep if Locus ceruleus is hyperactive during sleep. Those traumas are going to persist and most of the trauma treatments that I'm aware of are everything ranging from cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy, EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, there's a lot of interest and attention on um clinical studies on exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin and MDMA. So it’s a vast landscape, none of which, as far as I know, is really focused on sleep specifically no they're not, and they should be because actually psychedelics is a sleep-like state and um. It’s a rem, sleep-like State, although of course there are some major differences. So yeah so much to talk about here so antidepressants um are often neurodenergic or serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors. So they leave norepinephrine actually out there in the synapses. And what that does? Is it inhibits REM, sleep and if you're able to get REM sleep, it would probably be REM sleep with some neurogenergic activity. So actually I think anyway, I'm not a physician that antidepressants are counter-indicated. You don't want to take them. If you've experienced a trauma and you're experiencing PTSD, because if anything, it’s going to make it worse or at least prevent the type of adaptive REM sleep that you really need in order to resolve those emotions and move on um. Is that statement specific to antidepressants that tickle, the noradrenergic pathway, so the the one that comes to mind is I can never pronounce it brupa prion, which is uh. What I think brand name is Wellbutrin, it’s a dopaminergic and noradrenergic Agonist, but so that’s the net effect. As opposed to the Prozac Zoloft variety, which are ssris - yes, yes, but ssris themselves - also are problematic because we didn't talk about it yet. But the dorsal rafae nucleus, which produces serotonin, which the specifics serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block from being reuptaken, leaves too much serotonin out there and what serotonin also is another neurodenergic, I'm sorry, another neurotransmitter, that’s down regulated during REM, sleep, that’s specifically off during REM, sleep And what serotonin does? Is it weights all of our cognition to being able to recognize novelty again, so it sort of Waits our brain away from a sense of familiarity and toward novelty and um? It might be one reason why it’s an effective antidepressant, because it makes the world feel fresh and new again right, but you, when you have too much you're, holding a novel, traumatic memory um in your novelty encoding structure too strongly already. You don't want to again weight things toward novelty. You need that absence of Serotonin also to help you get that sense of familiarity and to start erasing the novelty encoding structures. So you need both to be absent. It’s really interesting. We hear a lot about serotonin and uh. It’s not often discussed in terms of its features related to novelty enough. I think, and what you just described, accused me to something that Dr Paul conti and others have said in terms of trauma, and here I'm paraphrasing. So my apologies to them for not getting this exactly right, that that an effective treatment for trauma does not erase the traumatic memory, but it causes a transition of what once was disturbing and invasive and maladaptive to eventually just become kind of a boring old story. That has kind of a fuzzy texture to it, as opposed to this kind of sharp High friction, texture that invades our thinking, um and obviously our sleeping States as well so um, again and uh. I appreciate the disclaimer or the caveats around. You know not being a clinician Etc, but I do think that there's a lot of interest now in whether or not antidepressants are effective for trauma or not, and I think these these aspects of neuromodulation as they relate to um. Let'S call it erasing traumas or changing the emotional load of traumas during sleep. Um is something important to take note. We also have a lot of clinicians that Listen to this podcast, so they should also take note um, please. So if I want to reduce the amount of norepinephrine released from Locus ceruleus during rapid eye movement, sleep to eliminate the troubling or maybe even traumatic memories and allow late stages of sleep each night to have their maximum positive effect, is there anything that I can do? Besides, avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic or neuroadrenergic compounds well, I would also avoid anything just prior to going to sleep that might excite those systems so a lot of novelty. A lot of you know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try and enter sleep with as much calm as you can so maybe deep breathing exercises that’s a beautiful way to calm your sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system is deep breathing and we haven't been able to test this with rats because we can't ask them to do a deep, breathing exercise. There might be a way we can do that, but I haven't found out or figured it out yet. But if there's a way you can make your sympathetic system nervous system, calm down before you go to sleep, might free for you, meditation or deep breathing exercises might be for some a warm bath or a comforting book. Nothing too exciting, but um. Also, nothing too boring. Perhaps um just something right in the middle, which makes you feel happy and calm as what you should do and if you instead go to sleep while you're, anxious or um you're hyped up, then your sleep could become maladaptive. Another thing that happens in rats that we have yet to know if it happens in women, is that female rats have three phases of their Ester cycle that their Locus realist doesn't seem to calm down during REM sleep as much, and we don't know why. But during the high estrogen phases of their estracycle, the locus shuts down just like it does in male rats, but in the other three phases it doesn't so um. One thing that might work and in fact there are a few studies that show it. It could work. Really well is um uh, giving women after a trauma event something that contains estrogen, because estrogen somehow is protective against PTSD, and they know that through retrospective studies, where they gave women an emergency room, either a pill with estrogen and or without, and those that had pill With estrogen in it were much less likely to get PTSD from that trauma as measured a year later than those that had the pill without so um. There'S some really good Studies by Bronwyn, Graham she's, out of Australia, to really hone in on how much estrogen do you need and also testosterone? Just so you know it gets converted to estrogen in the brain. So testosterone also can be protective because it gets converted to estrogen, but there's something about estrogen. That’s really helpful and protective about that from from the high Locos cyrillus firing - and this is again preliminary data that we don't have full. We don't have all the answers yet and um. We are looking into it actively right now, but it’s really important. The other thing about women is that we are two to four times more susceptible to anxiety- related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder. So if we could figure out what's happening to the locus oralis during sleep in women, um that and then figure out a way to normalize that so the locus realist is silent when it needs to be silent, I think we could go a long way in Helping women be more resilient to stress related disorders. What are some other um sex differences as they relate to sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s a really good question: there have been very few studies, unfortunately, uh of women in sleep, um, women and estracycle or menstrual cycle, and sleep and um. But what we have found, which actually largely replicated a study in 1960 um, is that that women or females, rather at high estrogen High hormonal phases of their estracycle or menstrual cycle sleep a lot less, but that sleep is more efficient so that sleep is more dense. In those sleep spindles, which I haven't gone into, what they might do, except this connection between the hippocampus and cortex, but it’s those sleep spindles, are more dense and more coherent across the brain areas. The Theta cycle, which is 5 to 10 Hertz in the hippocampus important for one year, learning and also important during REM. Sleep is also bigger and juicier during the high hormonal phases. So even though there's less sleep, it’s more efficient and better um, but uh. So so all of that efficiency seems to be reduced in those other hormonal phases um. So, even though you might sleep a little more um, you might need more sleep. In fact, in order to accomplish the same thing that you can get with that short um, very efficient sleep of high hormonal phases very interesting, I think um. There is a growing Trend, at least among nih-funded grants to require that as they refer to it in the grants, a biological sex as a variable yeah, and then here we're talking about sex, the um the verb - although I'm sure there's studies about that too. But biological sex is a variable because there is a dearth of studies exploring sex differences in in most everything, there's all sorts of reasons for that, but, more importantly, that, fortunately, the trend is Shifting yeah um and even when you study males versus females a lot of People just say include females in their studies, but then don't track the estracycle or menstrual cycle and hormones have huge effects on our Behavior. I mean just think of it when he's had sex. You know before our hormones come in we're not interested in it and suddenly you know, that’s kind of a main driver of behaviors hormones can definitely change who we are and what we do so we should be studying hormones, not just sex. I always say that puberty is perhaps the most massive transformation and rate of Aging that any of us go through in a short amount of time, an individual, their cognition changes, their Worldview changes and that’s largely hormonal, driven and obviously neural architecture has changed too um. I'M very happy that you mentioned I'm trying to get into Commerce States prior to sleep and some ways to do that. I'M a big fan - and I've talked a lot before on this podcast about things like Yoga Nidra, which is a non-movement based practice, sometimes called non-sleep depressed, where people actually take some time each day to practice how to go into a more parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately because it’s a bit of a skill, yeah yeah, it’s um and there's there's some good data, really mostly out of a laboratory in Scandinavia, showing huge increases in um Nigro, striatal dopamine, when people go basically engage in a practice of deliberate um non-movement and that the Brain actually enters states of a very shallow sleep, so sort of nap-ish. But the idea is to actually stay awake but motionless, and it does seem to restore a certain number of features of neurochemistry. But perhaps more importantly, it teaches people to to relax, which is something that most people are not very good at um but in any event, um and people who listen to this podcast have heard me say this over and over again. So I sound like a broken record, but this practice as a zero cost practice that doesn't require any pharmacology does seem to really enhance people's ability to fall asleep more quickly and to fall back asleep if they wake up in the middle of the night. So, in any event, another plug for nsdr Yoga Nidra. Well, I just also want to add to that. That’s one of the reasons why insomnia is so Insidious is because when people feel like they haven't gotten enough sleep and aren't getting enough sleep and become anxious about getting enough sleep and then you're anxious before going to sleep like I'm, not going to fall asleep, it’s Going to be 45 minutes in and then that’s a positive feedback loop, so you need to bring break that Loop, say: okay, my body's going to get as much sleep as it needs. I needn't worry about it and then practice this relaxation to say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going to be all right and and then concentrate on things that relax you um, whether it’s concentrating or not, concentrating whatever it is. You mentioned um Yoga Nidra, and that reminded me of Transcendental Meditation, which is something that also hasn't been studied well or largely, because we can't ask non-human animals to do it. And so we don't know what's happening with our neurochemistry and our brain activity. In a deep and meaningful way, but one thing that has has been shown in those that can do it really well, is that that Theta activity that I said happens when you're learning something or when you're in REM, sleep it it’s well established and and increases during The Transcendental Meditation, so it might be that some states of meditation could in some ways re, replace or mimic some functions of, for example, REM, sleep. But again we don't know if all the neurochemistry is right to do. For example, the thing that I was talking about, which is erasing the novelty encoding structures, the brain that needs an absence of norepinephrine and serotonin, which we don't know if that goes away with with Transcendental Meditation. We just don't know the answer to that. Yet yeah. The studies on on Yoga, Nidra and sleep replacement are kind of interesting um. It does seem to be the case that nothing can really replace sleep except sleep, but that if one is sleep deprived or is having trouble falling back asleep that these um things like - and I hear it’s - I acknowledge this is essentially like Yoga Nidra, but we now Call it non-sleep deep, breast or nsdr, because oftentimes for names like Yoga Nidra act as a kind of a barrier for uh. What would otherwise be um people willing to try a practice? It sounds mystical. It sounds like flying carpets and you know it sounds like you have to go to esslin by the way esselyn's a beautiful place, but it sounds like you have to go there or live in the west coast to believe in this stuff. But it’s simply not the case. These are practices that that are really just um self-directed relaxation as a practice that that allows people to get better and better at directing their brain States towards more relaxation, and most people have an asymmetry like, for instance, most people can force themselves to stay up later, But they have a hard time going to sleep earlier and that just speaks to the asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive in survival, based that we can ramp ourselves up far more easily than we can tend to calm ourselves down yeah, and actually you know to appeal to other Christians, like me, prayer, can be a wonderful way to calm yourself down because through prayer you're giving your cares to God and saying you know, and then you are relaxed more relaxed. And I just want to say that, because the same reason that yoga might put some people off, it might put some people off um to to talk about prayer. But it’s the same process of being able to relax and yeah and get outside our own experience. A little bit experience, yeah, um back out, get a world view that might actually also help us to relax um. Well, you might be surprised at how many um clinicians and scientists who've come on. This podcast have mentioned things like prayer from various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism, Muslim traditions and others that um as a as a parallel to all of these things - and I think what it speaks to is the fact that ultimately, the biological architectures that we're all contending with are Going to be identical, right and so different ways to tap into them and ones that are um congruent with people's beliefs, I think is - are great yeah um yeah, because anything non-congruent with your beliefs is also stressful, right and feels forced, and that’s why you know this Idea of calling it non-sleep deep rest in addition to Yoga Nidra was not to detract from the naming or the history around Yoga Nidra, but I was finding that it was a barrier you know likewise. Um you're gon na need your attempts to include things like intentions, whereas nsdr scripts, and by the way we will provide links to some nscr and Yoga Nidra scripts. But nsdr has no intentions. It’s simply a body scan deep relaxation based. So it’s sort of the scientific version of all of this stuff and actually we study it in the laboratory and and some of the brain states that people go into, but that’s a discussion for another time. This is hard. My mother used to tell me when I said well, we could play. I can't go to sleep, she'd say well, you know start with your toes and relax, so you would clench your muscles around your toes and relax them and do that all the way from your toes all the way to your head - and I don't know where she Got this, it might have been her own common sense or she might have gotten it from this uh NP NPR show it’s called the mind, can keep you well, she at least to listen to, but that’s another intentional relaxation that focuses on the body um rather than On your own mental processes, but I do a little bit of work with the military and um there's a method within certain communities of Special Operations in the US military where, if they can't sleep or they're having challenges sleeping, they will deliberately try and relax their facial Muscles, in particular, like sort of drape, the facial muscles and use long or exhale emphasized breathing does seem to increase the probability of transitioning back into sleep and those are Hallmarks of Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and, and so I think, all of these things Converge on on a common theme, you know, as a neurobiologist, we can say all of the things that we are describing certainly move the needle away from Locus ceruleus activation, and we haven't done the experiment to really look at that. But it seems all these things are counter to noradrenaline release. Another one is yawning self is with that kind of sort of tensing of all the muscles in your face and then relaxing them. So it might be why we on we don't know why we yawn yet but um, it might also have. It would be really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, you know my Bulldog was a was a Perpetual if he wasn't sleeping, he was yawning and it would be interesting to see what yawning does to the Lucas realist. Does that also come and switch local circles activity, because it’s an interesting that facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, you know the through the vagus, connects um indirectly to the locus aurelis and has a powerful effect on that interesting uh common. I think friend of ours and direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, was a guest on this podcast telling us about all the amazing structures. He and others have discovered in the in respiration and breathing. Yeah sounds like we have a collaboration Brewing here, the three of us should should definitely carry out I'd love for you to share with us a little bit more about these spindles that have come up a few times, and I don't know if it’s relevant to this. So if it’s not, let's separate it out, but I'd love for you to tell us a little bit about the role of sleep in problem, solving and creativity and if spindles are involved and I'll. Consider myself lucky for batching them in the same question and if they're not involved, simply feel free to separate them out. I think they could be involved and the reason why I think that could be involved, because we now know a lot more about spindles. First of all, the first thing that we knew first of all, we ignored them. Then we thought they had something to do with keeping us asleep, and that was their function is when an external stimulus came. They would keep us asleep because they would arise. But now we know that the density of our sleep spindles, the number that we produce per minute, is well correlated with our intelligence in the first place and that no matter what your intelligence is and no matter what your sleep spindle density is, if you learn something During the day and increase your sleep, spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated with our ability to consolidate that information and incorporate it into the schema that we already have in our brain. So if you try and learn something new, even if your sleep, spindle density at Baseline, is great, if you don't increase your sleep spindles that night you're, not gon na, you know, use sleep to really incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles are poor in those with schizophrenia. It’s one of the characteristic signatures of sleep is that sleep spindles are very few and far between which might mean that um, that people with schizophrenia might not be able to incorporate new information into already existing schema and instead, it sort of Flaps in the breeze out There and can be accessed erroneously at times when you, you know, you don't want it to be involved so um, I digress, so sleep, spindles and creativity. So one of the things we now know through some great Studies by Julie, seat and Anita luthy, is that sleep spindles are accompanied by an incredible plasticity out in the distal dendrites, the listening branches of our neurons, that listen to other cortical areas. So there are proximal dendrites in our neurons that listen to the external world and are conducted through the thalamus, and then there are distal dendrites which listen to an internal kind of you know, conversation that’s having happening in our brains. It’s kind of you know our internal State really and during sleep spindles. That’s when those distal dendrites are able to best learn from other cortical areas and from the hippocampus. It is during sleep spindles of the hippocampus and the cortex are best connected and when that class, incredible plasticity can happen. When I talk about schema, that’s a cortical cortical thing: that’s when you know the image of Santa Claus and presence you know comes together. It’s not through some external thing, once we learn those things together, it’s our cortex that that encodes that and brings those images back up together and that during sleep spindles, when that’s happening when that there's big surges of calcium into those distal dendrites and where plasticity happens In in just huge amounts, during that sleep, spindle stage of sleep, which is N2 stage, there's also some another excitatory event that comes all the way from the brain stem and projects everywhere in our cortex, which is called pgo waves. That’s P for pons G for ingeniculate nucleus of the thalamus, which is where they're first discovered an O for occipital area, which is our visual area, which is again where they're first discovered. But in fact it’s now been shown that pgo waves, which we should generalize to p waves because they come from the ponds and go to the thalamus, and then the cortex happens all over the brains. And that is where glutamate, which is a major excitatory neurotransmitter involved in learning and plasticity, is being released in big amounts, also in those distal dendrites. So p, waves and spindles work together to cause plasticity, and so our schema together, which could be the origins for insight and creativity. Now, when pgo waves or p waves, or first discovered, it was thought to be random, because this small area that generates p waves all over the brain, you know projects all the all over the thalamus and causes p waves all over and you don't measure p waves. All over the brain at the same time, in fact it’s just seems sporadic and random. So that’s, probably and p waves are also happening even more during REM, sleep, rapid eye movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s why people think that REM dreams are so Random is because these p waves are random and they could generate dreams because they're, an internal source of excitation. That kind of replaces the outside world during our dream state, and so these p waves, if they are random, could could function, could be the underlying reason why REM sleep dreams are random, and it might also be why creativity can happen. There is because we're randomly activating co-activating different things in our brain that we can then sew together, but it might not be as random as we think so. That’s a caveat there. I just learned a lot from you because I I teach brain stem to medical students and I talk about the pawns and the pawns like this dense collection of all these different nuclei involved in a bunch of different things. And it’s close by a bunch of interesting things and it’s still kind of a mysterious brain area. But when I learned about pgo waves, I thought pawns geniculate occipital, because occipital is most commonly associated with visual cortex. I thought it was the origin of the visual component of dreams. It probably is I'm very happy to learn that they should be called p waves, because they include lots of different areas of the brain, and it makes really good sense to me why the kind of pseudo- randomness of Dreams, especially these late night and early morning, um later In sleep I should say, and early morning, dreams seem to be cobbled together from kind of disparate experiences. I mean you walk through a door and suddenly it’s a completely different context and Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. I I like this idea a lot. It makes intuitive sense, it makes biological sense. It also gives me something to talk about to the medical students next quarter. When I talk about pawns - and you want to talk about where in the ponds it’s right below the locus surlist, it’s called the sub surrealists they're glutamatergic. It’s also called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. So I love it so um note to any aspiring neurobiologist there's a a vast landscape of yet to be undiscovered structure and functions in the pond. Do you want to work on something that is sure to reveal something novel work on the palms, because it’s in every textbook, it’s a clinically, very important structure, um, sadly, gliomas can and another cancers of the brain can sometimes can often Surface in the in the ponds, but but we still know very little about it. Um I read a paper this last year or - and I think it was covered in a bit of popular press - that during rapid eye movement, sleep people can solve problems or respond to external stimuli like, for instance, they would give them math problems, they'd whisper in their Ear, while they were in REM, sleep, you know, what's two plus two and people would say, even though they were paralyzed, apparently they could still move their mouth because they'd say four or something like that or they'd say you know. What'S your name and people could respond and so that in REM sleep, perhaps people um, some elements of cognition are still active. I'M glad you brought that out. What do you think and I don't know the authors of that study and um and uh listen. If Ever I say something wrong, it’s great on this podcast, because someone will tell us in the YouTube comments it’s one of the great uses of YouTube comments, but I'd love to know your thoughts on that study I mean: is that just kind of a a an Odd feature that or does this have meaning, should we actually care about this result, there's no just about it. It’s really actually intriguing and interesting and might relate to this paper that I talked about where we, where we said different areas of the brain, can be in different states. At the same same time, so lucid dreaming is another thing. We can't ask animals to do or can't ask them if they've done it but um. We can certainly ask humans to do it and some people can do it really well, and it would be really interesting to see in those people who could lucid dream really well, whether they spend more or less time in this asymmetrical state, where one area of the Brain is in one state and another area. The brain is in another, and it might be that those people can respond to questions during REM. Sleep best are those that have the most asymmetry or or dissimilarity or dissociation between subcortical and cortical structures, or it might be that they're, the ones with the most symmetry we don't know um. I do worry a little bit about lucid dreamy, because people are it’s a fad. People are really excited about it and to be able to remember one's dreams is fun, often unless they're nightmares, and but it’s really interesting or to be able to direct one's dreams if they are a nightmare. Is these really wonderful power to have and to be able to redirect a nightmare that has been repeated to something else and then kick yourself out of that repetitive nightmare is really nice, but um. I worry a little bit about because we know so little about. What'S actually going on in the brain, and if this lucid dreaming state is preventing us from, for example, from the locus realist from calming down or the serotonergic system from silencing like it should, and maybe what we're doing during this state is yeah. We'Re activating the learning and memory structures, but in a way, that’s maladaptive in terms of the Erasure that we need to do so. Maybe one of the reasons why most people don't remember most of their dreams is for good reason. Your hippocampus is in a state where it’s not writing new memories. In fact, writing out it’s the memories it learned during the day to the cortex and it’s immune from incoming new information, so um, so maybe lucid dreaming is bad because you're you're activating the hippocampus in a way, that’s writing new memories, and it might be really maladaptive For things like you know, PTSD, on the other hand, let me just argue myself right out of this when I used to have a repeated nightmare when I was a kid my mother was so wise would tell me well listen just next time. You'Re in that dream, you know, say: hey I'm in a dream and then change something about it. So she and I rehearsed what the horrible dream that it was. It was a big monster. You know running after me and my legs were like mud and I couldn't run away and it was just terrifying, and that was a dream I would have you know time and time again she said okay, next time. What are you gon na do in that? Monster? Comes after you laugh, so I'm gon na run away. No, you that’s what you do every time and it’s always the same outcome you can't run. So let's do something different like what what could you do? That’s different, so I came up with I'll. I could turn around and punch it in the nose, yeah, that’s great and so the next time I had that dream. I did recognize this is that same old dream, which means that there's part of my brain - that’s conscious enough to know that this that I'm in a dreaming State and then I didn't, have the courage in my dream, because I was still terrified to punch. You know or touch the monster in any way, but I did have the courage to turn around and look at in the eye and say no. That was enough. I said no, and that was enough to knock me out of that Rhett of that dream, so that I never had it again. I never had that same dream again and in fact it gave me peace about dreaming, because I knew that if ever there was a nightmare that was just too scary. I could probably do something to change it and knock myself out of it. So, even though I don't recommend lucid dreaming on a normal day-to-day basis, if it’s enough that can knock you out of a rut, one thing that happens with people with PTSD is they have the same repeated horrible nightmare, which is often a reliving of the day's trauma That that they had so maybe lucid dreaming can be used on occasion to be a powerful tool because there's so much plasticity that happens during REM sleep to knock you out of that ret of reliving that event and and just change it. You know, and you could probably practice, that during wakefulness um rehearse the event that happened, that was so traumatic and then just introduce a new element. Like you know, now I'm safe now you know the sound that was associated with that really traumatic thing. I should now associate with something else and next time I have that dream, I'm going to change it so that sound is now this new thing that it should be associated with safety, and that might be enough - maybe I hope, um to knock you out of that Repeated Nightmare and maybe even start you on the path to recovery, because if you can calm down about those nightmare stads of sleep, then maybe your Loca cyrillus, which is involved in stress, can also relax and you can do the Erasure parts that need to be done. I love it, I seem to recall a paper and I'll have to find the reference and and um send it to you. We will also put in the show note captions that described a protocol that essentially matches this um uh idea and well. I think what they had people do is either cue themselves to a particular smell or tone in wakefulness, then, to try and recall a recurring nightmare yeah then, during the night's sleep they have the tone playing in the background, which would then cue them to the wakeful State they're still asleep mind you, but in the pseudo, Lucid or Lucid State, and then try and change some variable as you're describing some either look the the um predator in the eyes or do something different yeah and then in the waking State. Take a little bit of time to try and script out a different um narrative altogether, and it took several nights as I recall or more, but that they were able to escape this recurring nightmare. It was like a week or something yeah, so you're familiar with this guy. It’s a beautiful study, I loved it yeah. We will put a reference to that. I um need to revisit that site. What'S pretty recent, but I need to dive into it again because I think I I didn't go as deep into it as I. I should have no no, but the one thing that you, you said many right things, but one of the things you said is that they were able to cue the dreamer um when they knew when they were going to REM, sleep, and then they played the sound Or had the odor now, when you're, normally asleep alone in your bed, you're not going to be able to cue yourself, but it might be that rehearsal enough before you go to sleep. Is enough to you know, help cue you to that repeated nightmare, remembering what the nightmare is and then figuring out how to cue yourself to do something different for years I had the same recurring nightmare over and over and over again, and it was so Salient and So clear and I'm not going to share what it is, because it’s um it’s not that it’s that disturbing it was just. I think it was the emotional load of it and just how Salient certain features were like one person in um who's, a real life person had a particular um clothing, yeah on and it’s like, and that just served as this cue and yeah. I don't know if I ever did any direct work to try and deal with it, but now it almost seems silly to describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams are usually silly to describe. It was a pretty violent Dreams. Yeah and your emotional system is so geared up during REM, sleep, which is another thing we could talk about yeah, please um, I would love to yeah so Locus. Aurelius has ideally suppressed, so we can't release norepinephrine. We can't act out our dreams um this uh during these very emotionally Laden, um thoughts and and storylines during sleep. This almost like, starts to sound like a little bit of a built-in um, while sleeping trauma therapy, because most trauma therapies involve trying to get people into states of um counter to what most people think you actually want to get close to the trauma. In terms of the narrative but try and suppress the emotional activity of it or - and I guess that’s - the motivation for ketamine-based therapies for trauma, or I've also heard - and this is still perplexing to me - that other waking based trauma therapies involve taking people the other way. Making it very cathartic take them to the peak of the emotional Response but then allow that to finally cycle down into a more relaxed response. So please um, if there's anything about Locust, ceruleus and and dreams, and that can help people basically extinguish traumas or traumatic features to to real life events. And we definitely want to know about that yeah yeah. Well, I think one of the things that people thought might help after a trauma like a school shooting or whatever you know. Car accident is to talk about it and in, but in fact that ended up being counterproductive, and I think one of the reasons why it was counterprotective is because it didn't take them back down um. It brought them up and continued to reactivate the emotions of it. But then didn't you know, emphasize the safety effect that it’s over um or help them work through how they might avoid it again in the future to calm the sympathetic nervous system down again before they went to sleep, and - and none of these studies has sleep ever Been considered, but to me that’s, the key part is bringing down your sympathetic nerve system before you go to sleep so that your sleep can be adaptive. Your Locus realist can shut off like it normally does, or should do and then able to erase the novelty of it. The other thing that um I just mentioned a minute ago, was that the emotion system is highly activated in REM, sleep and that’s definitely true, and that might seem counterproductive in terms of you know the nightmares and and how to help REM. Sleep be a therapeutic thing. Rather than a um than a in reinforcing the emotionality of the trauma - and I think the key to that again is the absence of norepinephrine. So, even though the emotional system is in high gear, without norepinephrine, you can actually divorce those highly activated emotions from the cognitive parts of the memory that you have just written out in that NT stage of sleep when the sleep spindles are going so um, so you've Just now Consolidated the information that you'll need to survive and to you know to make that adaptive and now you need to divorce from that schema and from that semantic parts of memory. The emotional part, because whenever you remember something is fine, if you remember them being emotional at the time, but you don't want to bring back and so into that memory all of the same emotional systems. You don't want to bring back. You know the heart rate, changes and the sweating, and and all of that you want to be able to remember all the parts of it and even remember that you were traumatized and that you did cry and that you did have you know your heart was racing, But when you're talking about it years later, you don't want to have to relive all that. Otherwise, who who would ever want to recall a dramatic memory because you're, basically putting yourself through the same trauma, which is what people with PTSD, have they don't want to recall? This traumatic memory, because it’s reliving it like it’s just happening again. So that’s what we're thinking is that um, the emotional parts are no longer are not able to be divorced because the norepinephrine system is not downscaled during REM, sleep and so that REM sleep serves to. Instead reinforce and in fact amplify the emotions, because your your emotional system is up, look surilis, says Hi re-sewing in every night, the emotionality of those memories and with the memory itself um told us a lot about Locus, Aurelius and norepinephrine from Locus cerules. Is there any role for um, norepinephrine, epinephrine and cortisol released from the adrenals? My understanding is that norepinephrine and epinephrine will not cross the blood- brain barrier, which is probably why we have a brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah Locus ceruleus and other and other neurons. Actually, that’s a question. I should ask you: are there other sites in the brain where norepinephrine is released from or is it just Locus, cerules um? So there are, but it just occurred to me that um, in some cases like with raphae, there are other sources of serotonergic Drive in the brain. But raphae is like the means. Yeah, that’s the one that goes to the cortex and and and the locus roles is also the one that goes to the cortex. But there are other adrenergic sources, some that from the brain stem that descend and help us to ignore pain, for example, um. When we're stressed and needing to run away from the tiger right, we don't want to be thinking. Oh my ankle hurts you know you want to just be able to ignore it and go do what you need to do so um yeah. So there are lots of other neurogenergic nuclei, but the local sterility is the main one that projects all over the brain. The actually the only place that doesn't project is the dorsal striatum. You talked about ventral, striatum and addiction. The dorsal stratum is the only place. The locus Rose doesn't project to and that’s involved in, and procedural learning motor learning. The kinds of learning that take over when you're hippocampus, for example, is compromised. Bilateral. If you don't have good hippocampus, you can still do procedural learning and do and it’s great it’s a redundant system and so um. If your Locus cerealis is not working, if you don't have it anymore, you can still do if you, if you don't, have a good hippocampus, you can still do learning through this dorsal stratum structure, so it might be for those kinds of learning functions: sleep deprivation, where You never let the locus really stop. Firing is okay, because it doesn't have any receptors for norepinephrine anyway, so yeah, and what about bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, you know, I I often remind people there's no such thing as adrenal burnout per se. That adrenals don't actually burn out um, but some people have adrenal insufficiency syndrome. Other people have adrenals that are just chronically cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine and cortisol at the wrong times in particular, yeah yeah, so that those are great questions and I think the answers to them have yet to be discovered. The connections between our periphery and our central nervous system, but we know that there are beautiful connections and it’s untapped source of being able to manipulate our brains is to work through our bodies, and so our adrenals do great things. They constrict our blood vessels causing higher blood pressure which help blood rush out to all the extremities that need blood um. You know our muscles, for example, for running away from the lion um or the Tiger, or meeting a grant deadline or catching a train or catching a train. Yeah the adrenals help our hearts bump faster. Our muscles get profused with the blood it needs. It diverts blood and everything away from our parasympathetic system, which is rest and digest. We don't really need to digest that croissant when we're running for a train. We can do that later um. So it’s doing really important things. What we don't know because it doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier, is how that affects the brain and whether our, if we can independently activate our adrenals um when a time when our brain thinks that we should be fine and calm and asleep. How our brain detects. That and is it a feedback through our heart is racing, and then our brainstem says what's going on. My heart is racing and then wakes us up, and then our hearts are racing together with our brain racing. We just don't know the answers to these questions. Yet there are some good good studies, old studies, but we need a lot more. I will another nod to the Fact that there's lots of great work ongoing and still to do I'd love for you to tell us about some of the work that you're doing more recently on the relationship between sleep and opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse and um and craving just addiction generally uh. I get a lot of questions about people trying to come off benzodiazepines or people's challenges with benzodiazepine and other types of addiction, um yeah. What? What is the role of sleep in addiction and recovery from addiction and opiates, in particular yeah? This is a very young area and in fact my laboratory has just started. I have a graduate student who's been in my lab for just one year. She'S done amazing work already, but completely groundbreaking work and what she has discovered already. We don't have the paper out yet, but we're working on it is that when animals withdraw from opiates - and this has been sort of replicated in other ways with other types of things, our sleep is Disturbed, our sleep is terribly Disturbed and the amount of sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors and you might think well course you're going to relapse. If you can't sleep because opiates calm you down well, one of the reasons why opiates calm you down is because the locus cerealis again loose fat is covered with opiate receptors and that are normally really responsive to our endogenous opiates, um and so what? What happens when we're pleased, for example, or laughing or whatever and Dodges opiates um activate those receptors in the locus rules and calm it down it actually suppresses Locus activity makes us happy and relaxed. One of the things reasons why opiates are so addictive is because it also calms us down and makes us relaxed, but the problem with exogenous opiates is that they really strongly bind these receptors on our Locus cerillas. And if you take an exogenous opiates again and again, like you're recovering from surgery, for example, take these pain medications is that our Locus really struggles to do what it’s supposed to do, which is keep us awake and learning and concentrating on things. So it will down. Regulate it will internalize these receptors that are normally only occupied by endogenous opiates, and, and it will do this, it will change our genes that are associated with producing these receptors, so you actually have very many fewer receptors. So the locus rules, at least during wakefulness, can fire and help us to do these things like learn about our environment, and so, if you long term reduce the number of receptors out there, then when you withdraw the exogenous opiates, it’s not enough of your endogenous opiates To to be able to reoccupy those few receptors that are there and our local spirulis has nothing to calm it down, anymore, no pacifier and it just fires and fires and fires, and that phasic and tonic High activity stresses us out, because it’s normally associated with stress And so any exogenous stressor that adds to that and also activates her Locus roles, there's nothing to calm it down again, and so it just keeps firing. It disturbs our sleep and that’s why maybe sleep disturbance is a an indicator of a hyperactive Locus, cerillas and um and such a good predictor of relapsed behaviors, because nobody likes to live in that high stress state and they'll do anything to get back to normal. So the problem with with um taking these drugs is that it leaves you excited and or sorry excited, relaxed and happy, but then, when you come off of it you're worse than whether anywhere at Baseline, you take it again um. It only brings you up this far because you have fewer receptors when you come off it you're down even more depressed and and anxious and are depressed as a word I use Loosely and that’s not that’s not what I certainly central nervous system depression. I mean sleepier less motivated, lower mood. Yeah I mean our local surrealis is actually it’s a it’s in the anxiety kind of depression. Actually, the anxiety related depression, so um yeah, so we don't know yet what and there's some good research going on right now? What could restore our own endogenous receptors so that our own doogenous opiates can properly calm or Locus once that they have been tamped down by exogenous opiates, but that would be really one way that you can access the sleep disturbance. So we talked about sleep and the importance of sleep in terms of learning and memory, the importance of the structure of the 90-minute cycle. For all of that. So you can imagine. If your sleep is disturbed by too much Locos activity, then the the structure and the function of those sleep spindles and that Theta during REM, sleep and the and the lack of norepinephrine all of those structures. All those functions for for learning something new like a new behavior that doesn't involve the drugs becomes compromised, and so that’s something that Tanya lugos in collaboration with Pamela Kennedy at UCLA that we're looking at how is learning and memory affected by the sleep disturbance? Is there a way we can um in animals that are coming off of opiates? Can we restore their sleeps to normal, so that then they are less likely to do relapse kinds of behaviors, fascinating and I'm? I will certainly have to have you back on to tell us the results of those studies. Meanwhile, I think for anyone, who's trying to come off opiates, exogenous opiates and restore these systems um. What I'm hearing is that it’s going to take some time, but that any and all things that people can do to buffer their healthy normal sleep architecture like morning and daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering the temperature at night, a number of things that we've talked About on this podcast deep breathing exercises meditation whatever it is. That helps you calm yourself before sleep yeah right would. This would facilitate not just sleep but perhaps even accelerate the the recovery and um and shorten this period of withdrawal which, from the questions I get and from what I hear um can be absolutely brutal, yeah um. So I can imagine I had to take opiates, for I only took it for three days after giving birth to my um first son. I think Second Son, one of them and um, and just I just said after three days. This is enough. I'M just going to try Tylenol, and so I I leaned myself, not weaned. I just did a sudden sharp cut off, and even though I felt I didn't get the high of opiates when I was taking the um Tylenol codeine um, when I went off it boy, it was like PMS times 100. I was so anxious and upset at little things. It thankfully only lasted a few hours, but if I had taken it for a week or two weeks who knows if that my endogenous opiate receptors would have been permanently down regulated and I would have been an addict, you know an addict, I would have been addicted. I shouldn't say an addict: there's negative connotations: it’s just a very physiological state, so no judgments at all associated with it, so um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, but can also alter your entire brain and rewire. It yeah well, um. All the more reason why I and many others are grateful that you're doing this work to figure out ways that people can recover um more quickly and more thoroughly. I must say: you've taught us a tremendous amount in um in a relatively short amount of time about the architecture of sleep, the different phases, the relationship between sleep and dreaming, and this incredible structure Locus cerules and I'm so happy. We also got into the ponds that just Delights me because uh we rarely talk about the pawns on this podcast, but such an interesting structure, sex differences that are important in creativity and problem solving and um and Trauma sleep spindles. Just such a wealth of information and much of it, that’s actionable for people. So, first of all, I want to say thank you for taking the time to sit down and have this conversation that so many people are sure to benefit from. I also want to thank you for doing the work you do, even though I'm a fellow neurobiologist, I think that um, it’s not often that um we take a step back and realize that it’s really the work of um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. It stands for principal investigator by the way pis like yourself graduate students and postdocs that really drive the discovery forward and that lead to these new Therapeutics Physicians are wonderful. Clinicians are absolutely wonderful, but clinicians don't develop new treatments. They only implement the ones that researchers discover. So, thank you for being a brain Explorer with um, with a focus on um growing, the good in the world um. I know I speak for everybody when I say thank you so much. Thank you so much Andrew. Thank you for being an amazing interviewer. You brought a lot out of me in a coherent form fashion that normally, I can't do when I'm speaking in public. I don't know about that. I'Ve heard your lectures and their superb we'll direct people to some of the other ones. Well, thank you, and I also want to put a plug in for graduate students in general and then a key and amazing role that they play in research um. I I'm a pi. As you said, I used to be a graduate student and a postdoc trainee myself doing all of this on the ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s so hard to do it’s so hard to do right, it’s so hard to think through. All of that now I'm a pi. I get to be an idea, person and just say hey: why don't you do this and hey you know? What do you think about that, and they, of course, intellectually contribute so much to these these planned experiments, but they also do the really hard work, and so I just want to say thank you graduate students, thank you to my graduate students and all graduate students out There thank you, underpaid and and listen and to the major institutions. Stanford UCLA and all other major institutions pay them more. Please! Yes, we need them and they need to have a standard of living. Not I'm not afraid to say that despite my primary employer pay them more, they need it, they deserve it. They deserve it absolutely great. Well, we will absolutely have you back again if you, if you'll be willing - and meanwhile we will Direct people to where they can learn more about you and your exciting work, and once again thanks so much. Thank you so much. Thank you for joining me today for my discussion about sleep, mental health, physical health and performance with Dr Gina Poe. I hope you found it to be as informative and as actionable as I did in fact, I'm already implementing the regularity of bedtime plus or minus half an hour in order to get that growth hormone release, and I can already see both my sleep scores.

Please put those in the comments section on YouTube. I do read all the comments. In addition, please check out the sponsors mentioned at the beginning and throughout today’s episode, that’s the best way to support this podcast on the Huberman Lab podcast. We often discuss supplements, while supplements aren't necessary for everybody. Many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like enhancing the quality and duration of sleep, for enhancing focus and for hormone support. The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to announce that we've partnered with momentous supplements we've done that for several reasons. First of all, momentous supplements are of the very highest quality. Second of all, they mainly focus on single ingredient formulations, which is absolutely key. If you want to develop a supplement, regimen, that’s most biologically and cost effective. It, for instance, allows you to alternate dosages across days to change the dosages of individual ingredients so on and so forth. In addition, momentous supplements ship internationally, which we know, is important because many of you reside outside of the United States. If you'd like to see the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast, please go to live, momentous, spelled ous, so that’s livemomentis.com Huberman! You can get a 20 discount on any of those supplements. Again, it’s livemomentis.com Huberman, the Huberman Lab podcast has a zero cost newsletter. That includes summaries of podcast episodes and toolkits, so checklists of actionable tools that you can use for all aspects of mental health, physical health and performance. You can access this completely zero cost by going to Hubermanlab.com, go to the menu and scroll down to newsletter. Just put in your email, we do not share your email with anybody and you'll get our monthly newsletter, and there are also some examples of previous newsletters, the also there at Hubermanlab.com. If you're not already following me on social media, it is Huberman lab on all platforms. Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin, and at all of those places, I cover science and science related tools, some of which overlap with the content of the uberman Lab podcast, but much of which is distinct from the Hebron Lab podcast content. Again, that’s Huberman lab on all social media platforms. Thank you again for joining me for today’s discussion with Dr Gina Poe, all about sleep and its relationship to mental health, physical health and performance and last, but certainly, not least, thank you for your interest in science. \", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='c:\\\\Users\\\\Win 11\\\\Desktop\\\\Llamaindexscripts\\\\assets\\\\sleep\\\\43_Dr_Samer_Hattar_Timing_Light_Food_&_Exercise_for_Better_Sleep_Energy_&_Mood_Huberman_Lab_43.txt', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\Win 11\\\\Desktop\\\\Llamaindexscripts\\\\assets\\\\sleep\\\\43_Dr_Samer_Hattar_Timing_Light_Food_&_Exercise_for_Better_Sleep_Energy_&_Mood_Huberman_Lab_43.txt', 'file_name': '43_Dr_Samer_Hattar_Timing_Light_Food_&_Exercise_for_Better_Sleep_Energy_&_Mood_Huberman_Lab_43.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 138227, 'creation_date': '2025-10-05', 'last_modified_date': '2025-10-05'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science, and science- based tools for everyday life. I\\'m Andrew Huberman, and I\\'m a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Samer Hattar as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast. Dr. Hattar is the Chief of the Section on Light and Circadian Rhythms at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Dr. Hattar has many important discoveries to his name. He was one of a handful of groups that discovered the light sensing neurons in the eye that set the circadian clock. This is a fundamental discovery made in the early 2000s that has led to an enormous number of additional discoveries on how light regulates our sleep, our immune system, our mood, mental health, metabolism, feeding, and many other important processes. If ever there was somebody who understands how all of these processes interact and can inform best practices for our daily behaviors, it\\'s Dr. Hattar. During our discussion today, Dr. Hattar answers questions that are absolutely essential for us to know about our health and wellbeing. For instance, how to align our sleep schedule with our activity schedule, such as exercise, and how to align light, activity and exercise with our feeding rhythms. He presents a new model of how light, activity, and feeding rhythms converge to support optimal health. And when those are not aligned correctly, how our mental and physical health can suffer. It\\'s a discussion that is rich with scientific mechanism, made clearly, of course, so everybody can understand, as well as specific protocols to deal with shifts in day length, shifts in activity, and in order to optimize sleep, metabolism, and wellbeing of various kinds. I learned so much from Samer as I always do. He is an absolute wealth of knowledge on all things related to light and circadian rhythms, physiology, and neuroscience. I don\\'t think you\\'ll find anyone else as knowledgeable about these topics as Samer. And so, I\\'m delighted that he joined us here on the podcast to share this information. Before we begin I\\'d like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I\\'d like to thank the sponsors of today\\'s podcast. Our first sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. I\\'ve spent my career working on the science of the visual system and I can tell you that one of the things that our visual system has to contend with is adjusting so that when we go from a very bright area to a dim or shadowed area, we can still see things clearly. ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with the science of the visual system in mind. And so they make those transitions seamless. You always see things with crystal clarity. Another great thing about these glasses is that they\\'re very lightweight, so you don\\'t even really remember that they\\'re on your face. And they won\\'t slip off if you get sweaty. The glasses were designed initially for running and for cycling and for active wear, but they work great for that and they work great, and they also happen to look great for work, if you go out to dinner, for social settings, so they can really be worn in essentially any circumstances. If you\\'d like to try ROKA glasses, you can go to ROKA, that\\'s R-O-K-A.com and enter the code \"Huberman\" to get 20% off your first order. That\\'s ROKA.com, enter the code \"Huberman\" at checkout. Today\\'s podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I\\'ve long been a believer in getting blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact our immediate and long-term health can only be detected in a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however, is you get numbers back, but you don\\'t know what to do about those numbers specifically. ROKA has solved that problem at a number of levels. First of all, they make getting the blood tests very easy. They\\'ll come to your house if you like, or you can go to a local clinic. Second of all, once you get your numbers back, there\\'s a very easy to use dashboard where you can identify obviously what the numbers are, but also the various things that you can do to bring those numbers into the ranges that you want; through either behavioral practices like exercise, through nutritional practices or supplementation, et cetera. So they made the whole thing very easy start to finish, in a way that allows you to best direct your health goals.

Today\\'s episode is also brought to us by Magic Spoon. Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free, keto- friendly cereal. I am not ketogenic, meaning I don\\'t follow a purely ketogenic diet. I tend to fast in the early part of the day, I tend to eat kind of low carbish through the middle of the day. And then in the evening I eat carbohydrates. That\\'s what works best for me, and allows me to feel alert all day long, and to sleep really well at night. Magic Spoon is a terrific snack for me because it tastes terrific; it\\'s got some sweetness, but it doesn\\'t take me out of that state that I want to be in during the day where I\\'m sort of ketoish, I would say. I\\'m not actually in ketosis, but I\\'m following more or less a low carb diet during the day, which keeps me alert. So either fasting or low carb, and Magic Spoon is consistent with that. And then as I mentioned before in the evening, I do eat carbohydrates. Magic Spoon has zero grams of sugar, 13 to 14 grams of protein, and only four net grams of carbohydrates in each serving. So I think it qualifies as low carbish or low carb. In addition, it only has 140 calories per serving. It\\'s also just delicious. They have flavors like cocoa, fruity, peanut butter, frosted. I particularly liked the frosted one because it tastes like donuts, and I particularly like donuts. Although I try not to eat them too often if ever. If you want to try Magic Spoon, you can go to MagicSpoon.com/Huberman to grab a variety pack. You can use the promo code \"Huberman\" at checkout, and you\\'ll get $5 off your order.

Samer, thanks for sitting down with me. - My pleasure. - Yeah, we go way back. So, you are best known in scientific circles for your work on how light impacts mood, learning, feeding, hunger, sleep, and these sorts of topics. So, just to kick the ball out onto the field, so to speak, how does light impact the way we feel? So, when I get up in the morning, I have the opportunity to interact with light in certain ways or to avoid light in certain ways. I have the opportunity to interact with sunlight or with artificial light. Maybe you could just wade us into what the relationship is between light and these things like mood and hunger, et cetera. - Sure. So, I mean, you do appreciate the effect of light for vision. So, when you wake up in a beautiful area, beautiful ocean, light is essential; the sunrise, the sunset, blue sky, beautiful mountains. So, that\\'s your conscious perception of light, but light has a completely different aspect that is independent of conscious vision or image forming functions. And that\\'s how it regulates many important functions in your body. I think the best that is well studied and well known is your circadian clock. And the word circadian comes from the word circa, which is approximate and diem is day. So, it\\'s an approximate day. Why is it an approximate day? Because if I put you or any other human being who have a normal circadian clock in a constant conditions with no information about feeding time, about sleep time, about what time it is outside, you still have a daily rhythm, but it\\'s not exactly 24 hours. So it will shift out of the solar day because it\\'s not exactly 24 hours, and hence the name circadian. - So, just to ask a quick question about that. When you say you have this about 24 hour rhythm, how does that rhythm show up in the tissues of our body? - Great question. So, it shows up at every level that we know we studied; it shows up at the level of the cell. It shows up at the level of the tissue, and it shows up at your behavior. The most obvious for you is your sleep-wake cycle. You sleep and you\\'re awake and sleep at the 24 hour rhythms. And if you measure the sleep-wake cycle of humans who are maintaining constant conditions, you will see that the period length of the sleep rhythm on average is more than 24 hours. In humans it\\'s 24.2 hours. So you\\'ll be drifting .2 hours every day out of the solar day if you don\\'t get the sunlight. So the sunlight adjusts that approximate day to an exact day, so now your behavior is adjusted to the light-dark environment or the solar day. - Okay, so if I understand correctly, if I were to go into a cave- - Yeah. - Or I would to be in constant light. - Yeah. - And I didn\\'t close my eyes- - Yeah. - In constant light, that I would still sleep in one coherent about. - Yes. - And I would still be awake for more or less one coherent about, maybe a nap. - Yes. - But the total duration of my day, so to speak, would be a little bit longer than 24 hours? - Perfect. - But if I\\'m in a condition like most people are where the sun goes up and the sun goes down, and I have some understanding of that sunrise and sunset, then- - You don\\'t have the understanding, you don\\'t have to have conscious understanding. You have the detection. - Right. - So, circadian photoentrainment is the word we use, entraining the circadian clock to the photic environment is completely subconscious. You\\'re not aware of it. It\\'s not like vision or image forming, where you actually know what you\\'re looking at. So, it\\'s all hypothalamic. It\\'s part of the brain that is not consciously driven. So, you actually do not know when it happens or when it doesn\\'t happen. And that\\'s what we\\'ll get into when I tell you why light affects your mood and why sometimes people don\\'t know how to deal with light to improve their mood, for example. - Okay, so this is a subconscious vision. - Yes. - Okay. Before you tell us about how light impacts mood, I\\'m curious, what is the relevance of adjusting this clock from a little bit longer than 24 hours to 24 hours? I mean, it seems like a small difference, 24 hours and 40 minutes or 24 hours. Like what\\'s the relevance? I mean, why should we care about that short difference? - So, let\\'s do the math. If you shift out .2 hours a day, in five days you\\'re shifting out one hour. So you\\'re literally one hour off in your social behavior in five days. In 10 days, you\\'re two hours off. And if you\\'re an organism that is living in the wild, shifting out of the right phase of the cycle, you could either miss food or you could become food. So it\\'s really essential for survival. I think it\\'s one of the strongest aspect of survival for animals to have the anticipation and the adjustment to the solar cycle. - And for humans as well. When you say animals, I\\'m assuming that applies to us? - Absolutely, yeah. - I see. So even though it\\'s just a short bit longer than 24, if that accumulates over days, then you could find yourself very much out of phase with the rest of your species essentially. - Yeah, so let\\'s say it\\'s .2 hours. So, in five days it\\'s one hour. In 25 days it could be five or six hours. You could be in New York and you\\'re feeling as if you traveled from New York to London. So, you would be having jet lag in New York, even though you didn\\'t do a jet lag travel. So it\\'s very important for the adjustment. And if we have time, maybe we could talk about why this is important for seasonality, because also it allows animals to anticipate the change in season. And the more you\\'re high in the north or the south, the more that these weather changes occur very harshly, and you have to be ready for them. And that happens in us as well. - All right, well, we will definitely get into seasonality. Okay, so we\\'ve got this subconscious vision that aligns us with the turn of the earth. How does that work? What is the machinery that allows that to happen? And how does that machinery work? - Yeah, so, we knew that in mammals, including us, we are mammals, humans, that the eyes are required for this function. So, if humans are born without eyes, or the optic nerves are damaged, humans are not able to adjust to the solar cycle. So we know that the eyes are required. And since we thought we knew about the eyes a lot before 2000, we thought that- - You say before the year 2000? - Before the year 2000, yes. - Mm hm, yep. - We thought it\\'s these photoreceptors in your retina that allow you to see. So, in the human retinas, there are two types of photoreceptors; they are called rods and cones because of their shapes. And these rods and cones simply take the photon energy, which light is made of, and they change it in a way to an electrical signal that allow us to build the image of the environment in our cortices. - Subconsciously? - Consciously in this situation cause it\\'s vision, right? It\\'s image forming vision, it\\'s a visual cortex, and associative cortices, which allow you to build conscious perception of the environment. However, people have found, including me with the work of David Berson and Ignacio Provencio, that there is a subset of ganglion cells. The ganglion cells are the cells that leave the retina, their axon leave the retina and project to the brain. So these were thought to only relay rod and cone information from the light environment to the brain. We found that a small subset of these ganglion cells are themselves photoreceptors that were completely missed in the retina. And these are the photoreceptors that relay light environment subconsciously to the areas in the brain that have and house the circadian clock or the circadian pacemaker, which adjusts all the clocks in our bodies to the central brain clock that allows them to entrain to the 24 hour light-dark cycle. - Incredible. So, as I recall \\'cause I was a graduate student at the time, in the year 2000, there was this landmark discovery made by you, Ignacio Provencio, David Berson, and others, that these cells exists that can communicate day and night information to the brain. - Yeah. - In this very small subset of cells. Since then, I\\'ve heard, but maybe you can confirm or refute that this system that connects the eyes to the rest of the brain is actually the most ancient form of vision. That this is probably the form of vision that some early version of human beings had before they had pattern vision, before they could see colors and shapes and motion and all that. And that the same cells that perform this role are actually similar to insect eyes. I think I heard David Berson say once that we actually have a little bit of the fly eye in our eye. What\\'s he talking about? - Yeah. So, it\\'s really interesting actually, because these same ipRCGs we discovered they contribute a little bit to image formation. And now, work from Tiffany Schmidt specifically have proven that they do contribute to image forming functions. But they contribute to very limited aspect of image formation. So, it fits your hypothesis that these are an ancient photoreceptors. The other thing that adds to that hypothesis is that they are expressed in cells that don\\'t have any modification that make them look like photoreceptors. So, the photoreceptors that I told you about that are important for vision, image formation, they have very specialized structures that allow them to pack these structures with photopigments; these are the photo-detecting proteins, so they could detect a high sensitivity of photons that pass through them. These new photoreceptors don\\'t have these specialized structures. So they just really need a lot of light at the time, we thought they need a lot of light to be activated. So that\\'s why we think they are ancient. And that\\'s why we think they adjust to ancient functions that are as important as regulating your body circadian clock to the solar environment, to solar day or to the light- dark cycle. - So, you mentioned ipRCGs, intrinsically photosensitive. So these are cells that connect the eye of the brain that behave like photoreceptors. - Right. - Essentially. And then you mentioned melanopsin, which is the actual pigment that converts the light into the electrical signal- - Yeah. - More or less. And my understanding is that melanopsin was identified first in frog melanophores. - Yes. - So does that mean that we have like little pieces of frog skin in our eyes? - So, honestly, David Berson say you have a fly in your eye because it sounds better. The more accurate I think is that you have a frog skin in your eye. It\\'s not as catchy, but really, the name melanopsin is from melanocyte opsin, so it\\'s melanopsin because it was found in the frog melanocytes. You know the frogs can change their color depending on light and melanopsin drives this response. So when Ignacio Provencio first discovered these opsins in frogs, luckily he was smart enough to see if they are expressed in the frog eye. They were expressed in the frog eye and it what appears to be retinal ganglion cells, which I told you, the one that connects the eye to the brain. He had the insight to go and see if they are expressed in the monkey eye. And he found that they are also expressed in what appears to be retinal ganglion cells, and really that what opened the field wide open. Then David Berson did the seminal experiment where he went to the brain where the central oscillator, the oscillator that drives circadian rhythm in the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, that has been known for many years to receive retinal input. And he labeled the cells that project there. And then he found that even if you destroy rods and cones, you could get light responses from these cells. So you could imagine he nearly fainted when he saw that these cells can respond independent, completely in the absence of rod and cone input. - Yeah, I\\'ll never forget reading those papers in 2000, 2001. I was at the meeting in DC when Ignacio, Iggy, we call him Iggy, showed this image of this basically what is frog melanophores in the human eye. - Yes. - [Andrew] And everyone was like, \"oh my goodness, this is the thing.\" - Yeah. - And I want to get into how light actually can control circadian rhythms. In a moment. - Absolutely. - But I think it\\'s worth mentioning now that people who are pattern vision blind, so people who cannot see and no conscious vision, but have eyes, many of them still have these cells; these melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive cells, and can essentially match or entrain, as we say, onto the light-dark cycle. - In fact, they possibly have no problems in circadian photoentrainment, they\\'ll have a normal sleep-wake cycle. - But they\\'re totally blind? - But they are totally image blind. And what\\'s really interesting is that, and this story I heard from Chuck Czeisler, so I\\'ll give him credit, that some of these people who are image blind, usually they get dry eyes and they give them a lot of pain. And doctors used to think, oh, since they are image blind and they\\'re getting dry eye, why don\\'t you just remove their eyes? They\\'re not using them anymore. And the minute they would remove their eyes, they start having cyclical sleep problems indicating that now they are not entraining to the light-dark cycle and are having cyclical jet lags when their clock shifts through the light-dark cycle. - That\\'s really interesting. And I hear from a number of blind people in my various aspects of my job, and a lot of them have issues with sleep. I think, in part because they don\\'t realize that they too need to see light at particular times of day or night in order to match their schedule. - Absolutely. - Well, I think that\\'s a perfect segue for us to talk about how light and viewing light can impact our sleep-wake rhythms. And then we\\'ll move into some of the other ways in which light can impact other forms of bodily function. - Yeah, so I love the way you set it up because one of the most interesting and difficult aspect of trying to educate people about light effect on subconscious vision is that it\\'s subconscious. So we\\'re all aware of what we think is intensity because we see the room, but if you talk to people who know how to take photographs and stuff like that, they know that the intensities varies greatly. But our system, because we have to see the same way in very bright conditions and very dim conditions, we\\'re not very good at estimating intensity consciously. So when you try to tell people about intensity, you really struggle because they think they know intensity, but they really don\\'t. - You mean light intensity? - Light intensity. - Yeah. - So the cones themselves have an incredible ability to adapt to different light conditions. So you can see at all different conditions. Otherwise it\\'d be a disaster. If you don\\'t change the setting on your camera and you go from inside the room to the outside, it becomes completely white, you don\\'t see anything. So if your cones don\\'t adapt to the environment, then you\\'re not going to be able to see in this room and on the beach, right? But the problem is your ipRCGs, the cells that we talked about, they measure intensity pretty well. They really know what intensity is. They have a very good linear measurement of intensity. They don\\'t adapt as well. They don\\'t adapt actually that much, to be honest. So that tells you that subconsciously the system is used to measuring light intensity in a natural environment, because when you are now in the natural environment, you don\\'t have industrialized lighting, then your system is functioning very well. But now when we change these environments, we could really mess up ourselves. So you have to teach people how to understand intensity. And that\\'s something that you have to explain to people. And I think I love to do it myself. I do it in what is called the lowest amount of light required to allow you to see comfortably. So you have to do this as an fun experiment. - Okay, so explain to me how this goes. And maybe we could break up the day into three or four parts. So let\\'s say assuming that most people wake up in the morning- - Mm hm. - As opposed to night shift workers, et cetera, we could talk about later. - Right. - But they wake up in the morning, so let\\'s divide the day into quarters. What is the proper way to interact with light in the first part of the day? - So, I honestly think the easiest thing is waking up, get as much light as you can. - To your eyes? - Yeah, it\\'s really nice. Your system is prime. If you\\'re entrained, it\\'s prime to get light, the sun should be out. Most animals in the wild, they actually seem to track the sun. The sun has a huge influence on life on earth. It\\'s actually life on earth is because of sun. So, that\\'s easy. In the morning when you wake up, you need light. Just get the light. - Okay, so what is the behavioral practice that you recommend? Let\\'s say somebody is in a condition where there\\'s a lot of cloud cover. - Yeah. - Is it important to get outside? - So, I have to tell you, the cloudiest day is going to be much more brighter than your room. You could ask any photographer. A cloudy day, unless it\\'s really dark, dark clouds, usually cloudy days have much more light outside than inside the room, even when you have good lighting inside the room. So I think in the outside is usually even when it\\'s cloudy, you\\'re going to get to enough intensity to help you adjust your cycle to the day-night cycle. - So, how long do you... These are general rules of thumb, but how long do you recommend people go outside? - So, if you do it daily, you possibly need very few. If you do it daily, because remember this thing is going to happen on a daily matter. So, let\\'s say 15 minutes. - So, the clock is tracking it on a regular basis? - Absolutely. It\\'s photon counting, it\\'s tracking. I would say 15 minutes. If you don\\'t do it daily, you may want to increase it. And we\\'ll talk about when you travel, what you could do, but yeah, 15 minutes should be fine. You do it more, it doesn\\'t hurt. - And through a window, my understanding is that through a window, it dramatically decreases the amount of light energy coming in. - It depends on how thick the windows are and how dark they are. So, but it\\'s also nice to go outside and to feel the seasons. - Sunglasses off? - I don\\'t use sunglasses. - Yeah, but you have your Jordanian photopigment. - Yeah, yeah, that\\'s right. - You know, so, yeah. Whereas my eyes are very sensitive, right? - No, but I personally, if I\\'m in the shade or if it\\'s not incredibly bright, I try to, especially in the morning, but I\\'m also an early person. So we have to differentiate between early- - What time do you wake up? - I wake up at 4:30 in the morning. - But the sun isn\\'t out yet. - It\\'s not out yet, so it\\'s- - So, what do you do? You turn on artificial lights? - I usually don\\'t turn on artificial light because I know the sun is going to come up eventually, but that\\'s why I don\\'t like the change in the timing that they do. - Wait, but what do you do between 4:30 a.m. and 7:00 a.m.? - I mean, I look at my computer, and my phone. - Oh, I see. - So possibly I get enough light, but in reality, I mean as long as you let your body get the morning sunlight, which I think is really, to me and there is no evidence of this, but to me, if you look at all animals, plants, this morning sunlight seems to be very important. And we don\\'t have experiments to show it, but I have a gut feeling that it has a huge impact on humans. - Well, Jamie Zeitzer\\'s lab at the Stanford Sleep Lab has shown that these early morning light flashes can adjust the total amount of sleep- - Absolutely. - That one will get. It makes it easier to get into sleep. - Absolutely, absolutely. And Ken Wright also did this beautiful camping experiments that showed that- - Maybe you could describe those \\'cause those are beautiful experiments. - Oh, yeah, they are beautiful experiments. He took these college students that had a late onset of sleep and late waking time, and then he said, let\\'s go camping and just don\\'t use any artificial light and you could go to sleep as late or as early as you want, and wake up as late or as early. And he found a huge shift in their sleep pattern just by exposing them to the light-dark cycle. I mean, so- - And it has lasted. - And it lasted, yeah. - Even after they came back. - Exactly. - Those two days of camping reset the circadian clock? - Seven days, but it lasted. Yeah, it\\'s pretty amazing. Yeah, it\\'s really incredible. - Okay, so get bright light of some sort early in the day, ideally sunlight, even on a cloudy day, it\\'s going to be- - Absolutely. - Brighter than indoor light. - So that\\'s easy. - Okay, so then- - And the other thing that I would like to mention to people, if you think it\\'s very dim outside, let\\'s say it\\'s very cloudy, stay longer. So remember intensity is only one component. Duration is also important because remember that the circadian system is not like the image system. In the image system you have to change every second because you\\'re looking at different objects. You have to change your perception. But for the circadian system it\\'s trying to figure out where am I in the day-night cycle? So the more you give them the information, the better you are. So, if it\\'s very bright, you don\\'t need a lot because it\\'s clearly going to make you fire like crazy. But if it\\'s not bright, stay longer, stay for one hour. You know, have your coffee outside or something like that. It\\'s just going to help. - I think you said something extremely important, which is that this circadian system is trying to figure out when you are in time. - Exactly. - Not where you are in space. - Sorry, I said, where you are in time. - Yeah. - I mean when you are. - Oh no, no, I wasn\\'t correcting you. I just meant that I think fundamentally that\\'s the incredible thing about this system. - Absolutely. - That you have this clock, this 24 hour clock in your brain, but it needs to be synchronized to the outside. So could we go a little deeper into this circadian setting behavior and come up with some general rules of thumb? So, let\\'s say it\\'s a very bright day. - Mm hm, mm hm. - Extremely bright. No clouds, the sun\\'s out. You said 10 minutes, 15 minutes. - And I\\'ll tell you if you\\'re sensitive, you don\\'t even have to go in the sun. You could be in the shade. There\\'s going to be so many photons out there in the shade. It\\'s going to be perfect. You don\\'t even have to see the sun. You don\\'t have to have the sun. You know, it\\'s great for vitamin D, that\\'s a different story. You could do this for your skin and protect your skin. That\\'s not my area of expertise, but for that effect on the circadian system, as long as you\\'re outside in the shade and it\\'s sunny day, 10 to 15 minutes should be ample amount. - Okay and then let\\'s say it\\'s kind of overcast. You know, it\\'s not particularly bright or there\\'s solid cloud cover, but obviously the sun is out, but it\\'s not as bright. How long do you think it would take to set the clock? - 10 to 15 should be sufficient. Stay for half an hour. Stay for 45 minutes. If it\\'s very darker out, stay for longer. - Okay and if for some reason, one finds themselves very far north, and it\\'s very, very dense a cloud cover. How long and at what point should somebody consider using an artificial light source to mimic the sunlight? - Yeah, honestly, this is where we don\\'t have a lot of information still, because this is where we\\'re going to discuss this maybe in more detail, that if you put humans in artificial conditions, the circadian system is very sensitive to light, but in reality, in the real environment, light also is affecting other aspects that are independent of the setting of the circadian pacemaker. - Okay. - And these which we call the direct effect of light on mood, for example. So, that is very hard to figure out what intensity you need to use. And we haven\\'t done enough experiments \\'cause this system has been discovered just recently. But I would say if you use bright light in the morning, and I mean, it\\'s hard for me to give numbers. 00:30:20 Sunlight Simulators, Afternoon Light Viewing, Naps It can get complicated. But yeah, I mean, honestly, if you\\'re that far north and you\\'re in the winter and you make sure you don\\'t, use these light boxes. I would suggest that personally, but that\\'s it. - I use, it\\'s actually not designed for circadian setting, but I have a 930 lux light pad that I bought and I bought it, they\\'re very affordable compared to the dawn simulating lights. - Yeah, you don\\'t need them. - Which are quite expensive, frankly. - Yeah. - And I put it there. And so, just basically, when I wake up in the morning, I use that until the sun comes out, and then I make sure once the sun is out, I go outside. But I keep that thing on all day. And I don\\'t know if that\\'s good or bad. Is a good or bad? - I, honestly, I don\\'t think being exposed to bright light in the day is going to ever be bad because really if you\\'re outside in the day... Unless, you know, the worst that\\'s going to happen if the temperature is very high, your body\\'s going to say don\\'t dehydrate and go to sleep. So you could tell actually sometimes when it\\'s very hot, the more you get exposed to bright light, the sleepier you feel in the afternoon, which is counter- intuitive. - Mm hm. And that\\'s to protect us, you think, against dehydration? - I think if you think about the human evolution from near the equator in between noon and a certain time in the afternoon, it would have been very hard for you to maintain physiological homeostatic function, being active at this very high temperature time. So I think napping was a way, that\\'s why I think it has a major function which is still... Napping was a way to somehow take you away from that dangerous zone. And maybe that\\'s why people in the north they say, in the winter we can\\'t wake up in the morning \\'cause they don\\'t have this long light. So, they sleep more at night. But in the summer they say, we feel like we can\\'t go to sleep. We have to put all these dark curtains. So, I think, venturing that much up north has been... Came up with a problem because evolution was used to a certain light environment that was completely changed with a human. With other animals, I think that lived there longer, they have come up with very interesting adaptation of actually measuring even very small changes in the light intensities that still occur. And so, even if you\\'re near the poles, even though it\\'s always light, but there is a change in the light intensity across the day-night cycle. So, your system, if it\\'s linear, and remember I told you that ipRCGs are incredibly linear, can still measure, oh, this is lower light than higher light if the organism has the ability to do that. - I see, yeah, it\\'s interesting. I\\'ve spent so much time learning from you fortunately about these cells, and yet I never really appreciated until now how on the one hand they are tracking the amount of light to understand when we are in time relative to the 24 hour cycle, but also that you keep mentioning this linear measurement of intensity; that they really are trying to figure out when we are in time by measuring the intensity of light. And of course the sun is the most intense source of light available to us. So, okay, so I think we\\'ve nailed down that first part of the day. - Exactly. - Basically it\\'s get 10 to 30 minutes depending on how bright it is, and try and do that as often as possible to give the system a regular source- - Daily is the best. This system is really about, and you\\'ll see that even for the effect on depression, it\\'s about multiple days it is. So you don\\'t have to worry if you missed it one day, stay longer if you want. But if you\\'re in a hurry and you want to do other stuff, that\\'s a great recommendation. - Mm hm, so you might want to compensate with some extra time if you missed a day or two. - Absolutely. - And this is why I\\'ve heard you say before, it\\'s entirely possible to get severely jet lagged without traveling. - Absolutely. - Simply by staying in, being on your phone too much, not getting the sunlight. - Absolutely. And you saw this during the pandemic. A lot of people mentioned that their sleep-wake cycles suffered a lot. Because if you\\'re not going out and if you\\'re staying at home and you don\\'t have big windows and you\\'re waking late, waking up late, and then you\\'re using very bright light too late at night, your body is going to shift. And now, your day is going to start instead of like really when the sun comes up, let\\'s say at six o\\'clock in the morning, so your day is going to start at 11 o\\'clock in the morning. That\\'s what your body\\'s going to think is the beginning of the day. So, then you\\'re not going to be able to sleep at 10 o\\'clock at night, because now that\\'s really for your body, it\\'s completely different timing. And you could see this happen during the pandemic at a very high scale. People get delayed in their sleep-wake cycle a lot. - And there is this idea of chronotypes, that we all each intrinsically have a best rhythm of either being a morning person. - Absolutely. - You called yourself an early person, or a night owl, or more of a kind of standard to bed around 10:30, up around 7:00 type thing. And I think there are now good data, correct me if I\\'m wrong, from the National Institutes of Mental Health and elsewhere showing that the more we deviate from that intrinsic rhythm, the more mental health issues and physical health issues start to crop up. - So, there is great data on this, and there is a couple of things that complicate this. The first is the people who usually are late, they tell you that the society doesn\\'t accommodate. - By late, what do you mean? People that wake up late and go to sleep late? - Go to sleep late and wake up late. They have an overwhelmingly higher level of depression and failures. I mean, clearly, I mean, the reason the people say sleep early, wake up early, you\\'re better because human notice that people who go to sleep early and wake up early, they do better in life. They notice that. - They just perform better? - They perform, but the question is, is that intrinsic to the system or is that society because society start things usually early or late? That\\'s a hard question to ask- - We discriminate against late risers. - In a way, we discriminate, right? But the other explanation is Ken Wright\\'s experiment. These late riser, if they were truly chronotypically late, why would they shift so easily when you put them in the... If you were really chronotypically late, and there is a phase relation between the light-dark environment and your circadian clock, then doing this camping experiment should not have caused much changes because it\\'s not that light is going to affect you in a certain way, it\\'s that this is the relationship that your body decided that I\\'m a late sleeper, late waking. So, I\\'m honestly, I\\'m still unable to figure out how much of this late waking up is controlled by the light environment and how much is intrinsic. I\\'m sure there are differences, but are they as big as we see in the environment? Because you have people that go off to sleep a 7:00 p.m. and wake up at 1:00 a.m.. These are clearly advanced phase- - So people that go to sleep at 7:00 p.m. and wake up at 1:00 a.m.? - Yeah. - And feel good doing that? - I\\'m not so sure they feel good, but a lot of the time you talk to people, they say they are high achievers, but they suffer because they go to 7:00 p.m., wake up advanced phase sleep syndrome. They call it a syndrome, but then you have people who would not be able to sleep till 5:00 a.m., and not be able to wake up till 3:00 p.m., right? And I\\'m not so sure that the circadian system is that variable in the human population. I mean, clearly there are maybe some genetic factors that make a small percentage of like everything with the bell shape. But I think most of the time, the light environment may play a role. And once, as we\\'ve talked about, this as a long-term effect of light. Once you get into a rhythm, and I don\\'t mean it as a pun, in reality, once you get into a rhythm, it\\'s hard to break out of that rhythm because if you start sleeping late and waking up late, you\\'re not getting the morning sunlight. - Right. - And so, you\\'re just going to be late. And if you\\'re like me waking up early, you\\'re getting the morning sunlight. You\\'re getting what Zeitzer said... I said his last name wrong. The one in Stanford who did the- - Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer, yeah. - [Andrew] He actually worked for- - Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer. So, Zeitzer and Czeisler. - Yeah, it\\'s confusing. - Yeah, there are a lot of zz\\'s and i\\'s in their names. - Yeah. - Both phenomenal scientists. - Yeah. - What it seems to me is the case is that the only way to really know if you\\'re meant to be an early bird as they call it, an early person or a late person, or somewhere in between is to get morning sunlight, and figure out whether or not that makes you feel better. - And to understand, to be educated about how to measure intensity. \"How to measure\" I put in quotation \\'cause you either get a measuring device, but you cannot depend on your eye to measure intensity. - Okay, so how do we do that? \\'Cause you keep coming back to this. So, that tells me that it\\'s important. - It\\'s very important. - So, obviously, so there are apps, free apps like Light Meter, where you can walk around and hold the button down and see how many lux are in the environment. - These are complicated because you have to point them to specific regions. - Right. So, how do people start to develop an intuitive sense of the measurement of intensity? - Yeah, I think at one point I posted on Instagram, how I keep my nighttime at home. And I found out that my night vision is very strong. So I found out that I, especially in the winter, I only need candle lights. So I literally use these tea lights, and I put like 15 or 20 of them- - How romantic. - And it\\'s so nice. I could see it clearly doesn\\'t affect my circadian system. - You and your cats- - And my wife. - And your wife of course. - It\\'s just great, right? But I don\\'t expect people to have the same night vision as me. So, I mean, I tell people, do the experiment. So if you put three or four lights in your room, switch two, sit for 15 minutes. - Switch two off? - Switch two off. Let\\'s say you\\'re using five. And see, after 15 minutes, you will not recognize you switched these two off. My gut feeling is that most people would need at least 10 times less light than they use at night to see. The problem people use it because most of the time they didn\\'t see the morning sunlight. They are actually hungry for light without their knowledge. So they come switch all these lights on, but at the wrong time. Because they woke up late. - Okay, now I understand. So, this morning light viewing goes way beyond- - Absolutely, absolutely. - Setting your clock. It\\'s also a way to determine how little light you need later in the day. - Exactly. - And we\\'re going to talk about this in a moment, but how little light you get later in the day is a very strong determinant of things like when you will wake up, whether or not you wake up feeling refreshed, et cetera. Let\\'s move- - And that\\'s why, - Yeah? - I\\'m going to break it on your show, Andrew, that I\\'m going to tell you, I think there is something else that people do need to think about, which is the tripartite model. That this model incorporate three components we should talk about in details that allows us humans and all animals to incorporate the circadian clock, and its relation to light, the homeostatic drive, and the direct effect of the environment, which includes stress, light, all kinds of stuff. They have to be incorporated together. If you think, that\\'s what I think right now, if you think of one alone, you will always miss something. And when you think of them as a whole, things really become clear. It\\'s actually quite amazing. - Okay, well, we will definitely want to hear about your tripartite theory and go into detail about those homeostatic mechanisms. I want to make sure that for people who are thinking now, I\\'m sure about light and how it impacts them. So the morning light viewing behavior, I like to think we\\'ve tacked down clearly. - Absolutely. - And thank you for that because there\\'s so much information out there and I\\'ve tried to relay that information. Of course, you\\'re my primary source for all things circadian, as well as Jamie and others, of course, and Matt Walker. But I think you\\'ve made that very, very clear. Now, let\\'s say I\\'ve gotten my morning sunlight. Okay, great. Maybe my bright artificial light, and throughout the day you said to get a lot of light. So, I\\'m working at my desk. Maybe I\\'ll go out during the day a few times, but I\\'m working at my computer, I\\'m doing things. Is there anything about light viewing in the middle of the day that people should keep in mind? Or can they just sort of freestyle it depending on what they\\'re doing? Most people are not in a dark room throughout the day- - Yeah, so my gut feeling, if you\\'ve got your morning sunlight, you walk from your car slowly or you walk to work, you didn\\'t wear sunglasses when the lights were still dim in the morning, that you could freestyle it. That even if you don\\'t get a lot of light, there is a way to just... In the day, you don\\'t have to just worry about getting a lot of bright light, but personally, I like to do that. So I go out at lunch and have my lunch outside as well. This reminds the body that here it is even brighter now. But the evidence is that you could literally help your circadian clock by giving lights at dawn and dusk. But again, if you think of the tripartite model, this may be important for the circadian clock, but is it important for your mood? So that\\'s where I think you need, or the homeostatic drive. So that\\'s where you need to think about it. So, for the clock, for entraining your clock, you literally can entrain it only by the dawn sunlight. You actually don\\'t need dawn and dusk. People usually forget that. - Yeah and I appreciate that you\\'re distinguishing between circadian effects and other effects of lights. - Yes. - You\\'re being very precise, which is appreciated. Until we hear about this tripartite model, which we will cover, for the sake of the discussion, let\\'s treat the light viewing behavior as what are the benefits or drawbacks of viewing light for all biological purposes, not just circadian settings? So, in the morning, it\\'s clearly going to set the clock. And then, during the day, if I understand correctly, the idea is to get as much bright light as you can, because you\\'re feeding, it sounds like a sort of light hunger. - Exactly. - I see. - I love this way to put it. I think there is a weird light hunger considering that we\\'re not photosynthetic organisms. There is a weird light hungers in animals that they need measure. And I think that relates to the season because the whole reproduction cycle of animals is going to depend on the availability of food in the environment. And if you don\\'t know when the season is going to happen, they don\\'t have calendars, it\\'s going to be very hard to survive. So I think that\\'s why we have this light hunger. That\\'s a major hypothesis. It\\'s not been tested. - Interesting. So, then afternoon and evening start to approach. So, I\\'ve had this weird experience. Maybe you can psychologically or biologically diagnosed me now, Samer. So, where if I go into a movie in the afternoon, like a matinee. - Uh huh. - And I come out and it\\'s dark, I notice a significant drop in my mood and my ability to go to sleep. Whereas if I get some view of the light in the evening, it doesn\\'t have to be the sunset, although sunsets are nice, but I get some light pulse in the afternoon that I have no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. - And this happens on a single time to watch them? - Yeah, more or less. - Wow, that\\'s interesting. - And then you mentioned the camping experiment where when they went camping, they\\'re seeing the sunrise and the sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. - So what should people do in the afternoon slash evening time in terms of their light viewing behavior? - I mean, the best thing to do is to let the natural light creep into darkness, right? That would be the best, but clearly that would be inefficient. You want to go home, you want to read, you want to talk to your kids, you want to talk to your family. So, I think it\\'s nice to extend the day. I don\\'t think that\\'s wrong. If you somehow can block that light from affecting your circadian clock. - So, should people use blue blockers in the evening? - I personally do not like any blockers that take a single wavelength of light. Because again, if you think of a holistic approach, yes, the blue blocker is going to prevent you from affecting your circadian clock very much. But then your vision is going to be distorted because we always see in full spectrum, the sun has this beautiful spectrum, right? And then when you start seeing without the blue, things look yellow and it can get really weird, right? I mean, so I personally, I\\'ve tried the blue blocker and I couldn\\'t even wear them. I thought they were just really horrendous to be honest. - Well, along the lines of blue blockers, I think a lot of people mistakenly wear them all day long. - Oh my God, that would be very bad. - A lot of people do that. - That would be very bad. - A lot of people do that. They think that blue light is bad. I think that the- - No, no, no. - The concept of blue light being bad led to a lot of product development. And a lot of people are just assuming that viewing blue light is what was giving them headaches. When in fact it might\\'ve just been looking at screens at close distance all day. - So, here\\'s the problem, right? I mean, the blue light got the bad reputation because people who gave a pure blue light showed that it \\'caused a huge retinal damage. But again, if you\\'re using blue light in its pure form, it has a lot of energy because it\\'s shorter wavelength, but we\\'re talking about full spectrum light. There are ways now where you could change the spectrum of the light and keep it white between day and night and change the content of the color without you noticing. So you don\\'t even have to affect your vision. - So how would you go about doing that? - So, you just lower the level of the blue light. You don\\'t have to eliminate it. - So just dim the lights? - Dim the blue, then increase the yellow, but keep all the colors in a certain white. So, you know, you could have different warmness of white. And people know how to do this. Physicist know how to do this. People who work with light know how to do this. - Well, maybe somebody in the wellness slash, I don\\'t like the word, but biohacking, or optical community will do this. I think it\\'s really important, I see so many people wearing blue blockers. - They have meetings now. I don\\'t know why they block- - Well, I think they\\'re just uninformed. I think, frankly- - Yeah and to be honest, it\\'s easy, right? It\\'s easier to explain to somebody if ipRCGs respond mostly to blue, remove blue, you\\'ll be fine. - Right, right. - Right? But that\\'s not as simple as that because they also receive rod and cone input. So you want to actually... And we could go into details, that\\'s boring for your listeners, but it also affect the adaptation properties of the whole retina. So you don\\'t want to do something so drastic that you take just one color of the spectrum. It just seems very counter intuitive to me, to be honest. - You\\'ve told me before as well, that just because these intrinsically photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best to blue light, if the light is bright enough because they also get input from other components of the eye, it doesn\\'t matter if you block the blues. - Yeah. - If you\\'re looking at bright light at night, you\\'re going to disrupt your circadian cycle. - Absolutely and that\\'s why I didn\\'t want to go into the boring details, but themselves, the photoreceptors have a wide range of responsiveness. So they are more sensitive to blue light, but that doesn\\'t mean they don\\'t respond to green light or to shorter than blue light. They respond to very, very wide spectrum with different sensitivity. So unless you understand the system just removing 480, I don\\'t think it\\'s going to do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, your home is a cave at night basically with some- - It\\'s a nice cave. - It\\'s nice cave. - Yeah. - With candles. - That\\'s right. - Right and you and your cats- - And I watch TV and dim it. - And your lovely wife. - Yeah. - Who I know, who\\'s also a phenomenal scientist in her own right. - Thank you, yeah, she is. - She is. But you do keep your home quite dim to dark at night? - Yeah. In fact, I did go to meetings with some of my friends who work on this and they really struggled with me. They said we could have broken our legs living in the same light environment that you do. So I am an extreme, but I measured it for myself. And I asked, Rejji, my wife, if she\\'s okay with it. She also liked the dimness. Both of us can see well in dim conditions. And that helps us a lot, but I think you have to measure it for yourself. You really have to... It\\'s a very simple experiment. Just try to dim the light as much as you can. I call it the minimum amount of light you require to see comfortably. - And that\\'s how you want your environment ideally at night? - At night. This is what I think is the game changer. If you reach to a level where it\\'s just barely, you\\'re literally on the cusp of seeing uncomfortably versus seeing very comfortably, you are going to be very much better than I don\\'t like to make it completely dark. I think complete darkness induce anxiety in humans, to be honest. So I don\\'t like complete darkness. - Kids don\\'t like complete darkness. They like a nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don\\'t like complete darkness. I mean, we have studies in animals that are nocturnal, that if you put them in complete darkness for several weeks, they have severe anxiety and depression like effect. So keep the light dim, use red light that is very dim, if you want to keep the room for sleeping. Red light that is very dim has very small effect on the circadian clock. And below 10 lux of red light, literally doesn\\'t affect sleep at all. So there are ways to do it. It\\'s just we need to educate the public. And I feel like you literally need a whole lecture to just explain to the people how to deal with light because it\\'s not as simple as people think. - Well, that\\'s what we\\'re doing here. - Yeah. - We\\'re stepping through it piece by piece and the reason we\\'re doing that is because it\\'s not as simple as saying, just block blue light or get a lot of light during the day, and minimal at night. - I mean, just to put it in perspective and tell that we only have three different cones in our retina that respond to three different colors. We call them red cones for simplicity, green cones and blue cones. Yet we have only three of these, but we could see massive palette of colors. So that tells you something. If the system was just simply about a single color and us just removing 480 or just blue is sufficient, then we should only see in red, yellow, and blue. We shouldn\\'t see all these different hues of color, but because the system is not that, we see all these different colors. And that\\'s why it\\'s important to remind people that the white light is made of many different colors. It\\'s actually like the rainbow. That\\'s why you see the rainbow, it\\'s made of many colors. White light is never truly white. It\\'s made of lot of different colors. - It\\'s like the Pink Floyd album cover. - Exactly. - With the light coming through the prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim at night, maybe dim red light ideally, or candle light. Find that minimum required light level. - Test it, just make sure when you lower the lights, sit for at least 10 to 15 minutes, let your system adapt. Because if you had a bright light and you switch it off, surely you\\'re going to suffer because your system didn\\'t adapt yet; it was used to very bright light. So you want to engage your rods, which take a long time to dark adapt. So that\\'s why I tell you, just wait a little bit. Don\\'t just switch it off and now I don\\'t see, put it on. Put it off, sit down, wait for 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes and then see how you see. And then once you do that, you will notice that actually, yeah, I could see quite well even with much less light. - What do you do regarding screens? - Yeah, that\\'s the hardest thing. Again, I mean, there are beautiful programs that change the whole intensity and color of the screen. These could help dim your screen at night to the lowest part. I mean, yes, you won\\'t see it when you wake up in the morning, but then you can increase that intensity. So, try to decrease. I mean, just what we were talking about. Think of light intensity, duration, color, and time of day. You really have to keep these four things together, right? - We\\'ve roomed together at a couple meetings from time to time, no longer, because one of us not to be named has a severe snoring issue that made the other one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] You can guess who that was. But I\\'ve seen you check your phone after dark once or twice. - Mm hm. - And you did it by sort of pointing your phone away from you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - And actually I\\'m sort of half joking, and you dim it quite a bit. - Yeah, dim it quite a lot. - I\\'m sort of half joking, but it actually makes sense that if you shine a flashlight in your eye, it\\'s much brighter than if you shine a flashlight- - Light only go in direct line, so if you\\'d just look on the side, most of the light is going to go this way, and you\\'re only seeing this way. - Okay, so, and as silly as that might seem to people listening, I mean what it means is that getting bright light in your eyes at night is something that you really want to avoid. But there is the reality that- - And even when I check sometimes if I have something, and I check it so fast and switch it off so fast. So I\\'m also aware of duration- - Not my messages. - I\\'m also aware of the duration, right? So duration, intensity, color, and time of day. Ideally I should not check iPhones an iPads. I don\\'t use iPad at night because it\\'s hard to lower it enough \\'cause it\\'s a huge. But even my iPhone, I try not to use it at night. And like once it becomes 8:30 or 9:00, I don\\'t look at it at all. - Unless it\\'s World Cup or Euro Cup, in which case Samer\\'s on 24 hours, everybody. - Right, that\\'s only every four years. - He\\'s a big soccer fan. All right, this has been incredibly, no pun, illuminating. Let\\'s talk about the relationship between light and some of these other non-circadian or pseudo-circadian effects. And we will try and link those. But you had a what I consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published in \"Nature\" a few years ago, showing that if you disrupt the exposure to light or the timing of the exposure to light that there are dramatic effects on the stress system and on the learning and memory system. Maybe we could talk about each of those separately or together. What are the effects on stress and the effects on learning when light viewing behavior and sleep-wake cycles are disrupted? - Yeah, so just to remind you, you know that, but to remind your listeners that I was trained as a circadian biologist. So I really was indoctrinated into thinking that light has to affect the clock, which then caused all these different effects. So, that\\'s what I believe. That\\'s my dogma. That\\'s what have made me really happy. And then Tara LeGates and Cara Altimus joined the lab and we started discussing a lot of data. And we said, what if there is a direct effect of light that we\\'re missing, independent of the circadian clock? So this is not an easy question to us to answer, because as we\\'ve been talking all along, light affects the circadian clock. So how could you give light at different times of the day and not mess up the circadian clock? Luckily, we came up with such a way, and that\\'s why it was important to do these experiments the way we did them. And we proved that this light-dark cycle does not disrupt the clock, there is still a circadian rhythm, and does not cause sleep deprivation. And yet, surprisingly, if you give light at the wrong time of the day, even without disrupting the circadian clock or without causing sleep deprivation, as you mentioned you get the huge mood changes in the organisms and you get learning deficit. So, this really, and at the time people have really hit us hard. I mean, it was really hard to publish this work and you could, yeah. - Well, it came out in \"Nature.\" - Yeah. - So in the end you prevailed, but I want to make sure that I understand. So, you\\'re saying that yes, there are effects of light on the circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep and wakefulness. - Yes. - And their timing. However, there are direct effects of light on mood that can be dissociated from the effects on sleep and waking. - Absolutely. - So if I interpret that correctly, that could mean that when we view light and how much light, could make us feel happier or less happy or even depressed, stressed, learning, et cetera. - Bingo. - Even if we\\'re sleeping and waking up at the appropriate time? - Bingo. I mean, eventually because we\\'re talking about the whole system, eventually when you start having the other problems, you also develop sleep problems, but you\\'re absolutely right. And in fact, now, research from Diego Fernandez in the lab have found that now we know that they actually require different brain regions. So we don\\'t only have a theory, we don\\'t only have a light environment that showed they can be dissociated, we know that they use completely different brain regions. So, the SCN that I told you about earlier, the place where the central pacemaker is, the one that receives direct input from the retina through the ipRCGs to adjust your circadian clock is not the area that receives the light input for mood regulation. It\\'s a completely different brain region. - What\\'s the brain region called? - So the brain region, we called it the perihabenular nucleus. I\\'m not so sure how good or bad the name, but it doesn\\'t matter, it\\'s that PHb. And what\\'s really amazing, this region also receives direct input from the ipRCGs, but projects to areas in the brain that are known to regulate mood, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which has been studied for many years to be impacted in the human depression. So just by this amazing serendipity to find that a region that is so deep in the advanced brain, like the prefrontal cortex is your executive brain, one of the most elaborated in humans, to see that they receive inputs from these ancient photoreceptor was stunning to us, and told us how much we didn\\'t understand the importance of light on a human behavior. - So, how does that finding inform daily protocols for you or for other people? I realize you can\\'t leap always from one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - To daily protocol. But if light indeed does control prefrontal cortex, executive function, learning, stress and mood, and let\\'s say I\\'m waking up each morning and I\\'m sleeping. What should I do different? - That\\'s why we came up with the tripartite model because yes, we could think about just adjusting the clock with lights in and being dark throughout the day. But that may not be important for your whole physiological function. So, now, if we include these other effects of light, that\\'s why I prefer to still get a lot of light in the day. I don\\'t want to be in very dim light condition throughout the day. - I see. - So, even though it doesn\\'t affect your clock, as you beautifully said, Andrew, it may affect your mood and learning and memory. It may affect your alertness level, which is going to allow you to learn better. It may affect your homeostatic drive, maybe your homeostatic factor would go higher so you could sleep earlier. So it\\'s important to think of light as stimulating all these brain regions, which means it\\'s producing more activity, which in reality this is how people think of the homeostatic drive, that the more active you are, the more the homeostatic drive is built up, the better you sleep. So that\\'s why we came up with the tripartite model because as a circadian biologist, I only thought of light through the circadian clock affecting behavior. As a sleep biologist, they only thought of the homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. And for people who study light for vision and other form, they thought only of the environmental input. But now if you put them all together, you get with this tripartite model where it\\'s really mind boggling. And it makes so much sense. The organism doesn\\'t want to depend on a single component, but if you could incorporate these three together, you could have a beautiful system that is well adapted. So let me tell you the sleep-wake cycle, right? So we know that there is a homeostatic drive to affect sleep. You\\'ve had beautiful talks about that. - Which is basically the longer you\\'re awake, the more you want to be asleep. - So, that\\'s your homeostatic drive. We\\'ve talked about the circadian influence of sleep and the fact that light-dark cycle affect the circadian system, which eventually affects sleep. So these two components are well understood. Now the third factor is your direct light or environmental input. How much stress, how much light you get from there also can highly impact sleep. So even if you have a good circadian and homeostatic drive, if you\\'re getting light at the wrong time of the day, or if you\\'re being stressed and thinking a lot, then your sleep is going to suffer. So you have to think of the three together to have a beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - I see. - And that\\'s why we came up with the tripartite model. The same thing happens with feeding. I could beautifully put it to people. Your hunger, your energy level is measured by the arcuate nucleus. Your daily intake of food is again, dependent on the SCN and light-dark input. We found that if food is not available, there is yet a third input that is not depending on the SCN, not depend on the arcuate, depending on a completely different brain regions. So the animal can actually start looking or the human can start looking for food when it\\'s scarce, even at time when they are not supposed to be active. So, that\\'s how the organism think, they have to evaluate multiple inputs for them to decide what is the best physiological outcome at that moment, at that season? - I see. So, I want to get into arcuate and feeding, but just to make sure we can keep our hands around this tripartite model. So, if I understand correctly, we\\'ve got the circadian influence, then you\\'ve also got the drive to sleep. - Right. - Actually, one of the ways that I think that can be best understood is if somebody ever pulls an all-nighter, they get tired around 11:00 or 12:00 or so, and then very tired around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., but then even if you stay up sometime right around 7:00 or 8:00 a.m., your normal wake up time, you start to feel alert again. - Exactly. - And that\\'s because the sleep drive is extremely strong, but there\\'s a circadian rhythm that drives wakefulness in the morning. - Exactly. - Okay, so that\\'s two are the components. - [Samer] Right. - Before we get into the feeding component, I want to talk about these direct effects of light on mood. - Mm hm. - Okay, Diego Fernandez\\'s data. And this perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, let\\'s just for the moment set aside the tri part of the tripartite model and just focus on what are the direct effects of light on mood? And the way that I interpret what you\\'ve said so far is that the protocol that emerges from this if one trying to optimize their mood is, yes, see light, view light I should say, early in the day, in order to set your circadian clock. Maybe also in the evening as well. And of course, avoid light at night, get it as dim as possible. However, you said, it\\'s also a good idea to get as much bright light during the day as you safely can, in order to improve your mood independently of regulating your sleep-wake cycle. - And that\\'s the hypothesis. Here\\'s the problem where it\\'s not going to be as satisfying as the circadian is that as you know, this brain region has been discovered very recently. - Habenula? - The perihabenular region. - Well, we\\'ve known about it a long time, but nobody knew what it did. - So, we knew about the habenula, but that\\'s why the name is confusing. It\\'s actually not the habenula itself. It\\'s the perihabenular. - Oh, near the habenula. - It\\'s near the habenula. - Why don\\'t you just call it the Samer Hattar nucleus? - I should have. I don\\'t know why I haven\\'t done that. - Maybe \\'cause if you do that, it\\'s not okay. Okay, so for here ever after the perihabenular nucleus, we should probably call it the Hattar- - The Hattar-Fernandez. - How about Hattar-Fernandez- Berson nucleus. - Yeah, that should- - Okay, this is like nerdy science attribution stuff, but I\\'m just going to call it the Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line it up. Okay, so this structure is taking light, and independent of sleep rhythms and circadian rhythms, it\\'s driving changes in mood. - Something. - How does it do that? Is this through the dopamine system? The serotonin system? - We still recently, we haven\\'t identified this region very well. We don\\'t know what light does to it. We don\\'t know how it interacts. So this is an area that is ripe for discoveries and we\\'re working on this right now. But that\\'s why I said, it\\'s not satisfying. This is like the function of sleep. Why do we sleep? We know sleep is very important to us, but we still don\\'t have a satisfying function of why do we sleep, right? - I see but the why questions- - We have hypothesis. - The why questions, I think it\\'s our good friend and colleague at University of Washington, Russ Van Gelder, who always says, when somebody asks why, that the best answer is just to say, I wasn\\'t consulted at the design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none of us really know why. - No, but the point is maybe I shouldn\\'t have said why, what is the function of sleep? It\\'s still very hard to know. What is the reason organisms have to go offline for so long? You know, people assume it\\'s for repair, assume it\\'s for learning and memory, assume all kind of stuff, but there is really no clear function for sleeping. There is no clear function for sleeping. I mean, if you talk to people, there are hypotheses. - I mean, all we know is that if you don\\'t sleep- - Exactly. - Or your sleep is very fractured, you get messed up. - And you could die even, right? I mean, it\\'s really bad if you don\\'t sleep, but we don\\'t know what is the function? What is that sleep have done to organisms that couldn\\'t have done with rest? What if you just could rest without sleeping? Just sit down and rest. - Well, my lab is trying to figure out whether or not these non-sleep deep rest protocols can compensate for sleep. - That would be interesting. - I mean, obviously sleep is better, but many people are not getting the sleep that they need. - Right. - But, okay. So, and if people are sensing that Samer and I are about to start talking over each other and arguing, that\\'s always the goal when we talk, right? - That\\'s right. - Unlike other scientists I interact with, when Samer and I get together, it\\'s considered a successful conversation if we get into a big fight, and then go for a big meal- - That\\'s right. - Where I pick the restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay, so let\\'s talk about food and eating and appetite. You had yet another, yes, I greatly admire your success in this way, yet another incredible discovery showing that there are direct effects of light on appetite and feeding behavior. Okay, maybe you could just summarize those results for people. - Honestly, that paper is the one that allowed us to come with the tripartite model, because we were thinking completely wrong about it. We wanted, this experiment, it\\'d be fun for your audience to hear why we started this experiment. Remember that when we discovered the ipRCGs, we figured if they are the only relay to entrain the circadian clock, then you could kill them and have an animal opposite to the one that we spoke or a human opposite to the one that we spoke about earlier. Where instead of having no pattern vision and have circadian photoentrainment, we could produce an animal that have pattern vision, but no circadian photoentrainment. - Hm, so circadian blind. - Circadian blind, but pattern sighted. And we succeeded in that. The problem when you have these animals, which I\\'ve told you many times already is that they don\\'t adjust to the day-night cycle. So doing experiments on them become very complicated. - What is their behavior like if you don\\'t have these cells? Are they awake and then asleep, awake and then asleep? - They just drift like the humans we\\'ve talked about. - They think they\\'re in Las Vegas with no clocks or watch- - They drift, exactly. - They stay up later every night and go to sleep- - They can either, depend on their clock. If their clock is shorter, they come in earlier. If their clock is longer, they come in later. - So they\\'re really messed up? - They really don\\'t adjust to it. If they were in the wild, they\\'ll be eliminated in a second, right? There is no way they\\'ll survive. So, me and Diego started talking and we\\'re like, what if we use non-light in training agent? And what is the strongest non-light in training agent? Food. So we thought that the light defective animals will have more sensitivity to food entrainment because as you know more than me, this is an area that you\\'ve worked really well on, for vision, if you\\'re image blind, your hearing and somatosensory get improved, right? The lack of vision improves your hearing and sensation. But we found actually that if you don\\'t have the light to system, actually the food ability to entrain the animal goes completely to the ground. Completely opposite to what we predicted. - So light viewing and feeding behavior are interacting in ways that support one another. - And that\\'s why we came with the tripartite model. We figured it\\'s different than sensation of the environment. When you sense with vision, vision and hearing interact, but your vision is a real full modality. You want to see. That\\'s what vision wants to do. You want to hear. That\\'s what hearing wants to do. You want to sense. That\\'s what sensing want to do. But for the circadian system, light, food, all these entraining agent, they somehow have to interact to keep a coherent system. You don\\'t just assume if you remove light, this one is going to be stronger. No, they need to know each others. The light informs when the animal is going to eat. - Well, what I like about this so much is that in the world outside of science, in which I don\\'t really exist in, but that I see a lot of, this kind of wellness and stuff with all this mind-body integration stuff. It\\'s interesting because people view the body more as a system, right? A system of organs that interact, as opposed to the way that standard science and medical profession is like, you work on the liver or you\\'re ear, nose and throat, or heart and lung, or brain or- - Wow, that\\'s a great way of thinking about it. - But the biology is integrated. - Yeah. - And so, for somebody who\\'s interested in effecting their eating behavior, something that you are familiar with, and that we will talk more about your experiences of in a moment, how should they use light in order to adjust their eating behavior? - Right. So, now that I\\'ve told you about all these interaction between the different inputs to the circadian clock, just you think about it as an engineer, what would be the best thing? The best thing is to know when your food times happen in the day, when should you get light, and when is your circadian clock in your system, right? So, if you eat at very specific times of the day, that\\'s another signal that is telling your body, your clock, you\\'re in a certain time of the day. So if you\\'re having lunch at the correct time every day, and you\\'re getting bright light, now you have two systems that are informing your clock, your clock is going to be better. - So regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes that fit your circadian clock. So, and in fact, if you do that, when I started doing this, and it helped me lose weight, is that I\\'m exposing myself to the right amount of light-dark cycle, I\\'m eating at regular time. It is amazing. You would be not hungry, let\\'s say you eat at noon, you will not feel any hunger at 11:45. And then all of a sudden the hunger jumps. This is clearly not an energy issue because it could not be that drastic. - No, the desire to eat is mainly driven by these cues, these hormone cues that are very exquisitely timed to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, but also to light. - Exactly. And you know, in the wild, you could imagine why energy level through the arcuate nucleus- - You should explain to people what the arcuate is \\'cause I don\\'t think we\\'ve done that adequately. The arcuate nucleus is an area of the hypothalamus that drives hunger and feeding behavior. And what we\\'re talking about is the fact that it\\'s taking cues from your viewing of light, believe it or not, is impacting your level of hunger. And this is a non-trivial way in which your timing of hunger and amount of hunger is regulated by when and how much light you view. So, let me ask you a couple of practical- - But can I just, this is really, before you asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. We said we are going to fight, but to me, the interesting thing to think about it, in the wild when you didn\\'t have the availability of food that we have, the arcuate plays a huge important role because if you weren\\'t successful in getting food, then the arcuate is going to tell you, look, you have to take risks and go get food because your energy level is very low. And that\\'s great, there\\'s tons of great research about that. But I think what\\'s missing is the fact in humans, we\\'re not getting to a situation... Most of us, we\\'re not getting to a situation where we have low energy levels. Most of the time actually we eat not because we are really have low energy, but because we want to eat. So I think that\\'s why I feel that the timing is very important for us because we always have enough energy level for us to eat. - Well, I mean, I enjoy eating so much that I\\'ll eat just for the sensation of chewing. - True, true. - I mean, I enjoy the taste too. - True, absolutely. - And I enjoy the social aspects when those are a part of it. - Absolutely. - But I literally enjoyed the physical act of chewing. - [Samer] Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - Which explains a lot. Okay, so how regular are you or do you recommend people be about mealtimes? Because what I\\'m hearing is that light viewing behavior is pretty straightforward. Get a lot of light in the morning and throughout the day, minimize it in the evening and at night, generally speaking, for sake of mood and circadian rhythm. But for sake of regulating timing and quality I should also say of food intake, because people clearly make better choices about food intake when they are anticipating a meal and they aren\\'t constantly hungry. And so, the ability to regulate hunger for particular phases of the circadian cycle is quite valuable for all people. Not just people trying to lose weight, but all people. Are we talking about down to the minute? - Absolutely not. - All right, so 12:00 noon is my normal lunch, let\\'s say plus or minus? - Half an hour. - Okay. So eat around between 11:30 and 12:30. - If that\\'s the time. And it depends if you also do multiple meals. Remember three meals, that\\'s a decision that somebody came up with, I don\\'t know why. - And nowadays, fewer people are doing that I think. - Yeah. - Given our friend, Satchin Panda\\'s work. - Right. I mean, so you could have two meals, you could have very multiple meals that are distributed across your active time. I agree with Satchin Panda\\'s work that try to avoid eating when your system is supposed to be relaxing, when you\\'re supposed to be at non-active times. So, limit your eating to the active time of your cycle. And that seemed to be, and Joe Takashi is doing some beautiful stuff on this, that seems to be incredibly important for aspect of the circadian. - And for health. - And for health. - Yeah, we\\'re referring to Satchin Panda\\'s work, he wrote a beautiful book called \"The Circadian Code.\" Maybe Samer, with some luck you\\'ll write a book as well. Meaning the world will be lucky to have that book, but Satchin\\'s data really strongly point to the fact that liver health, brain health, metabolic factors, and endocrine factors of various systems and organs all seem to benefit from having a period of each 24 hour day in which we are not eating anything and then eating at very regular mealtimes. - [Samer] Absolutely. - Let\\'s talk about eating and mealtimes and let\\'s move a little bit away from the science for the moment, although we will return to it, and talk a little bit more about your experience with eating and mealtimes. So, you\\'re looking in good shape lately. - Thank you. - I know you\\'ve been putting work into it. - Yeah. - We talk a lot and you\\'ve been exercising and you\\'ve been eating well, meaning quality food. You just came back from Jordan where I\\'m assuming the food is amazing. - Yes, the food is amazing and honestly, usually I gain a lot of weight in Jordan, but this time I didn\\'t gain any weight, which was really nice, so. - Yeah, when I met you, you were probably about 100 pounds heavier than you are now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. I\\'m 219 now. It\\'s crazy, yeah. - You had a lot of vigor then, and you have a lot of vigor now, but I know that you undertook a very specific protocol in order to lose the weight, based on your understanding of the circadian system- - Yes! - And of light, and appetite and mood. Maybe you could just tell us a little bit about what that schedule looks like. And we realize that this is not a prescriptive for everybody, but you found what worked for you. - Yeah. - To maybe just describe those changes. - I mean, honestly, I followed my circadian cycle, right? Of what we\\'ve talked about, right? So I dimmed the light at night, I slept at regular hours, I ate my major food in breakfast and lunch when I\\'m really active and I\\'m really hungry. And at night when I avoid dinner, because my circadian system really shuts off at 3:00. I\\'m an early person. Like you could give me anything I would eat before 3:00, after 3:00, nothing appeals to me anymore. My system is shut off. - Well, what time are you going to sleep? And what time are you waking up? - Oh, so in my case, I should have put this up. I mean, I go to sleep literally at 9:00 p.m.. I mean, I literally five minutes after 9:00 p.m., I\\'m completely out. And I wake up between 4:30 and 5:00 a.m.. So if I extend it, I go to 6:00 a.m., but very rarely. It depends on how tired I was. - And that, as I recall, was an important set of changes for you to be able to- - Absolutely. - Regulate your food intake. - Absolutely because then I\\'m having very big breakfast, and again for different people it\\'s different, I have a big breakfast at 7:00 a.m. maximum. So I have a big breakfast, coffee, and all this stuff. Then I have some simple snack around 10:00. Then I have regularly lunch at noon, or between noon to 1:00. Then I have another snack at 3:00. And the hardest time to regulate the food is between 12:00 and 3:00. This is when I really feel hungry all the time. - This is your equivalent of kind of late evening for most people. - Yes! - So for me, it would probably be between 7:00 and 10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - And then at night I\\'m completely not hungry, but usually as you said, the beauty or the enjoyment of food, like when my wife cooks some really beautiful Indian food, I eat, but I\\'m not hungry. And I notice if I eat with that, I usually gain weight. But if I regulate that at night, I also lose weight. So there is a combination of all these things that help you adjust the input of food, the input of light, the input of the clock, and the drive to hunger. - Yeah, I appreciate you sharing that. And I want to emphasize that some people are not hungry early in the day. They might be late shifted people. - Exactly. - In which case, eating later in the day will work well for them. - It will work well as long as they don\\'t eat early in the morning. That\\'s just, you have to work with your schedule, with your active schedule. - Yeah, you and I have been talking about this offline for years. I\\'m glad we\\'re finally having this discussion publicly now. What we\\'re talking about really is finding your ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly, exactly. - And finding your ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - And understanding how those two things interact. - And do you know the nice thing, as you said, finding them out is going to help you to understand how they interact because we know from the tripartite model that they are all interconnected. And for each person they\\'re going to be interconnected differently. So, for each person you would... You know, for me, if I exercise at night, I\\'m going to mess up my whole system. - When do you exercise? - Morning. Morning works great for me. I mean, it\\'s amazing. Morning exercise for me works great. If I tried one time, because it was easier for me to exercise at night before I leave, when the traffic is there from the night. And I think that messed me up because I couldn\\'t sleep well and I couldn\\'t wake up well. And that led to more changes in my food. I gained weight again actually, believe it or not, even though I was exercising. So I think this really makes me think that you have to think of the tripartite model to see what is the best times and what is the best interrelation between the different component, as you beautifully said, between your mealtimes, your light exposure, and your sleep that works for you. - Well, thanks for that. Usually Samer\\'s insulting me. Today, he\\'s complimenting me. I\\'m going to compliment him right back by saying, this is the first time that I\\'ve ever really understood how yes, light can control sleep. Yes, it control mood. Yes, it can impact feeding, but that it\\'s really about doing the self exploration to align those in the way that works best. And what I\\'m hearing, tell me if I\\'m wrong, but what I\\'m hearing is that once you understand what gives you the best sleep-wake cycle, then you should exercise during the period of time in which you feel most alert. And if it works for your schedule, ideally you would also eat during the time in which you feel most alert and then stop eating and stop light viewing behavior as you head towards sleep. - Right. So, the only thing I would say that complicates all of this, and that\\'s what makes me sad, is your light exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, I\\'m just kidding. - The people\\'s light exposure, right? This is what complicates it because you\\'re not going to be able to figure all this out if you\\'re shifting yourself out of your comfort zone. - By viewing- - By viewing light at the wrong time of the day. So, let\\'s say if you were under an ideal natural conditions, you\\'re a person who would sleep later than me. Let\\'s say we\\'ll sleep at midnight and wake up at 8:00 a.m.. Let\\'s say you don\\'t eat anything till noon, and as you said, you eat late in the evening. Then this would be perfect for you, but now see what happens if now you include the light component. Now, if you push your sleep from midnight to 4:00 a.m., now you\\'re waking up in the morning and you\\'re actually really not the morning... You\\'re working, I\\'m sorry, at noon instead of eight o\\'clock, and the time where you\\'re not supposed to be hungry, now you\\'re going to start eating directly at noon or something like that, or even delay it. And now you\\'re shifting your whole cycle. And you don\\'t know if this interaction between your sleep, feeding and the light-dark environment are still going to be maintained or not. And that\\'s the problem that people have. - So, as I\\'m hearing this what I\\'m realizing is most of us, probably me included, are messing up at least one, two, or three of these components. - Exactly, exactly. - But that the probe, the way to figure out what\\'s right for oneself is to start manipulating light exposure. - Right and I\\'m going to be honest, I\\'m biased \\'cause I believe that light is the strongest time giver. And a lot of people disagree. Some people think feeding is. - I always thought that light was the primary zeitgeber, the primary light- - Yeah, but a lot of people think it\\'s food. A lot of people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. - Have they read the literature? - I agree with you. I totally agree with you. - I mean, my understanding is that light is the most powerful driver- - Absolutely. - Of the things we\\'re talking about. - That\\'s why I think we need to regulate this first and everything else fits. And you know, the nice thing is that your sleep-wake cycle and exercise tell you really bluntly if you\\'re doing it right or not. - Tell me more about that. - I\\'ll tell you more. When I shifted my exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - When you moved from exercising early in the day to late in the day? - In the morn, yeah. It completely fell apart for me. I didn\\'t enjoy exercise at night. My pain tolerance for exercise wasn\\'t as good. I\\'m talking with N equals one and I\\'m aware of this. I\\'ve never tested this empirically, but at least to me, it really messed up everything. I started having problem because my body temperature would go up and that will affect my sleep. I possibly was running in the gym with a lot of lights. So maybe the light was a component, but for me, exercising in the morning, it\\'s so much better for me. But a lot of people can\\'t even think of exercising in the morning. So it depends on when you feel comfortable in your sleep-wake cycle and your exercise. I think that tells you if your system is in synchrony with one another. - That\\'s really interesting. We\\'re good friends, our friend, Pat Dossett, that we both know. - Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - He did nine years in the Seal Teams. And he\\'s one of these people he says, he\\'s happy to go for a run or a swim anytime between 4:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.. And he\\'ll train in the afternoon too \\'cause he\\'s a Seal Team guy and they\\'ll do whatever anytime, that\\'s part of the phenotype, but he feels best doing that, right? I like to exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - And I\\'m happy to skip eating until 12 or 1:00. - Great. - And I like to go to sleep around 11:30, 12:00, \\'cause I\\'m a normal human being rather than you who goes to bed at 9:00 p.m. - What about Pat actually? I\\'ve never asked him what time. - Pat? So, Pat\\'s ideal to sleep time, I\\'ve asked him this, would be around 8:30 or 9:00 except now- - Oh, so I\\'m like Pat! - Yes, but he has two young children, two years old and a newborn. And so, the cycle is disrupted, right? - Yeah, but that\\'s known, right? I mean the effect of childbearing. - Right. - And I think that we could talk about this, that\\'s more complicated- - Right. - But that\\'s pretty much. - Yeah, I mean, I think we need to come up with a new name for chronotype because- - I agree, I agree. - Chronotype implies that it\\'s just about sleep and wake; being an early bird or a night owl. And what we\\'re also talking about is how exercise and eating match onto those. - The the phase relation between them. - Right. - And the phases between different components, as you said. - \\'Cause they interact. - Because they interact. - Right. - And they don\\'t have to be in the same phase. Like let\\'s say my light and food could be very close to each other. Your light and food could be different, right? The phases don\\'t have to be, they can be plastic. So you have to find this for yourself. You maybe you\\'re a person who eats late at night, exercises late at night, or you may be a person who exercise early, eat later. So, as long as the phase is good, that\\'s what you have to find out. - Okay and if I understand correctly, when you\\'re talking about phase relationship, it means you want to lump exercise, feeding and light for- - And sleep. - And sleep in a way that as a coherent and total system makes you feel really good. - Temporally in a great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - And I think that- - And I could tell you to me is literally getting exposed to sun clearly in the morning, clearly at noon, I go out, I keep my windows in the office completely open, eating mostly in the early time of the day and exercising. And literally at the end part of the day, I\\'m not really in a more thoughtful vegetative state. Like I really can\\'t like after 5:00, I tell my students, if you want to tell me anything complicated, you\\'re wasting your time. My brain just doesn\\'t function. So even though I only sleep at night, but I\\'m really starting to shut off, ramp down. Really I mean, I could send email, talk about brainless stuff, but my power, my energy to do powerful stuff really drop tremendously. So all my students who know me very well, they put the meetings with me early in the morning \\'cause they know this is when I\\'m... So, everything for me and for me, it\\'s very tight. So it could be different for... It\\'s very clustered in the morning. It\\'s all tied together. And literally the remaining part seems to be just a vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, you and my bulldog, Costello, who unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - I did not, that\\'s so sad. - Yeah, Samer and Costello were good friends. Yeah, sorry to break it to you here. Yeah, he had a good long life and he went easy, but he had a circadian clock that basically would just sleep around 24 hours a day, minimal activity interspersed every third day or so. You do have this morning vigor. - Yes. - And I think other people are going to have more of an afternoon vigor. Do you think that this can change across the lifespan? The rumor is that teenagers naturally want to sleep in later and stay up later. Do you think that\\'s social rhythm? Or do you think that that\\'s actually biological? - Yeah, that\\'s a tough question. I mean, it could be both. One thing that worries me is that it seems that if anything, with age this morning rigor gets stronger. - You mean, you want people to become more of morning people. - More of morning people. - Well, why does that worry you? I think that\\'s good. - Because for me, I\\'m already very shifted morning. I don\\'t want to be one of these 7:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. sleepers at some point. - On the other hand, it\\'s also kind of nice because it\\'s quiet and you can get work done. - Yeah, but honestly from 4:30 till 7:30 when my wife wake up, it can be very long. Yes, you achieved a lot, but it\\'s quiet outside. So, I don\\'t want to be at 1:00 a.m., let\\'s put it this way. - You can tell Samer is more social than I am. - That\\'s right, that is true. - But we should touch on that actually. So, your wife, she follows a different schedule. - Yeah. - So, the social rhythm- - I\\'m honestly... - Is important I think. What should we do? How should we conceptualize and how should we adjust ourselves according to the social rhythm? - And I honestly love this hypothesis that people came up with and Pat\\'s kids reminded me of. Because kids are really going to disrupt your sleep-wake cycle, it seems like there is a chrono attraction. That\\'s usually people who attract each others have actually different sleep-wake schedule. And the idea being is that this allows them to take care of their kids throughout the day-night cycle. - And have a peaceful marriage. - And have a peaceful marriage in a way, right? So, I mean, we didn\\'t have kids, me and Rejji. So maybe this is, but it seems like evolutionary it makes sense that if you want to protect your kids, you don\\'t want everybody to be morning vigor, and then the kids don\\'t have. So you want it distributed across. I mean, it makes sense. - It\\'s a reasonable argument. - Yeah. - I\\'ve heard that one of the reasons that people think that the clock is not exactly 24 hours, but it\\'s 24 hours plus or minus 20 minutes or so, is because we believe that we evolved in clans or groups, villages, whatever, that were about 100 to 200 people. And in order to have protection around the early morning hours- - Interesting, same idea. - When we\\'re vulnerable to predation and in the late night hours, that you would want some individuals of our species to be naturally more like night owls and some more like early people. So your theory of parenting is similar in that way. - Right. - The social rhythm is a powerful rhythm though. Meaning if I go out and I\\'m tired, let\\'s say I\\'m tired at like 9:30. I don\\'t want to go out, like I\\'m to need- - So can I just say something about that? I think the social rhythm is powerful at the obvious levels. Like it affects your sleep, it affects how much you wake up or eat, but I\\'m not so sure it\\'s as powerful as people think on the clock. Now, eventually it will mess up the clock because now if you\\'re doing a lot of social at night, getting enough light, eating at the wrong time of the day, eventually you\\'re going to have an effect, but I don\\'t think just the social interactions themselves have been shown to affect your clock very strongly for some reason. - Yeah, that\\'s good to know. Well, for people hearing this, they\\'re probably getting the impression like I\\'m the night owl, and then Samer is the one that\\'s in bed at 9:00 and then wakes up at 4:00. But having attended many meetings with Samer, I can tell you that he\\'s the party animal. So let\\'s talk about that. I mean, let\\'s talk about the fact that you\\'re the partier, who\\'s up until 2:00 dancing at these various meetings, which I\\'ve seen. - Yep. - He\\'s actually a good dancer I\\'m told, but what should we do when we do stay up very late, for whatever reason; could be because we had to take a midnight trip to the hospital, an unfortunate reason, or it could be because you\\'re in the presence of people that you don\\'t see very often and you go out for a really nice night out on the town and you get to sleep around 2:30 or 3:00 in the morning. How should one get back on schedule? Do you force yourself to then get up and view light at the normal time that you would get up and view light? Or do you allow yourself to sleep in? What what\\'s the optimal protocol? - I would allow myself to sleep in, and remember this is a long-term effect. This is something that you live with for a long period. And remember I told you about the experiments we did with the mood, these required two weeks of that light schedule to cause mood disturbances. So these don\\'t happen just in a single day. - So this is the way you justify staying out late every once in a while. - Well, in the meetings you\\'ve seen me in, I\\'ve done this for five or six days continuously, but what you didn\\'t see that when I came back to my home, it took me two weeks as if I did a jet lag. So I really do suffer for two weeks after doing a six crazy night of staying up at night, drinking at the wrong time of the day. So it\\'s not that I\\'m completely okay with it. When I go back, everything goes back. It takes me actually literally two weeks to recover from the circadian rhythm meeting that you\\'ve seen me partying at some point. - Which is kind of ironic that the circadian rhythm- - I know. - Meaning people are totally disrupting their circadian cycle, but scientists are human beings too. - Right, so I think if you do it at very little occasions, I think you should not worry too much that this will have lasting impact. And the good news is that if you readjust your schedule, you could come back to it. The problem is when you maintain this wrong schedule for a prolonged time and it becomes chronic, prolonged periods of time, that\\'s when you have the problems and the accumulation of the problems. So when you have sleeping problem, you produce metabolic problem. When you have metabolic problems, you produce lack of exercise. And you could see how things can spiral out very quickly. And then it would be hard to come back to it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption is both a symptom of and- - Yes. - A cause of almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. - And certainly the metabolic syndromes that people are talking about nowadays and all of this, it all funnels back to light. This is what\\'s so remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. - And so we have these devices, and I use my phone and I use my computer. But do you think that the mere dimming of the screen or not interacting with screens, say 90 minutes or two hours before bedtime, according to what we\\'re saying today, this should have a profound effect on all these factors. - And it does. And I really believe it does. And, again, I think as Pat did these inventions where you get a pouch where you put your phone in a pouch. - Mm hm, so, what Samer\\'s referring to is our friend, Pat, this former Seal Team member, who\\'s also very impressive person in the landscape of business and family, et cetera. A real superhuman by any regard has this habit of taking his phone and putting it into a sealed pouch in the evening. - Yeah. - So it\\'s basically walled off- - And in his program he sends you actually these sealed pouches. And so that I think is a great idea because not only it will take away the light from you, but it also take away the distraction because you want to repair and recover, and sleep does that. And if you have your phone dinging all the time, or the light flashing from it, you\\'re just not getting enough sleep and you\\'re causing yourself major problems. - I never asked you this, but I realized now that I should have long ago, but I\\'ll ask you now. Why and how did you get into all this stuff? - Yeah, I mean, honestly, first of all, I wanted to study genetics and I knew I wanted to do PhD in genetics. But I only got accepted in one university at the time. And I joined the Learning and Memory Lab. And I liked learning and memory at the beginning, I worked on the snails on Aplysia californica, and started looking at learning and memory. But then the same lab was looking at these daily variation. I was really struck. Like you never think about it outside of science. It\\'s really struck me that organisms can measure day biologically. That was very shocking to me. And I just really got attracted and I wanted to see why does this happen? What is the effect of different times of day? And I just stuck with it. It just, it was mind blowing for me who was in medical school, that I\\'ve never heard about it before. You know, it\\'s really amazing medicine, I think still now we are very good at looking at stuff spatially, but we\\'re very bad at looking at temporal aspects. So we always like to see images, static images, spatial information. - Right, take an x-ray, measure a temperature- - Yeah, exactly. - Measure a blood pressure. - But we don\\'t think of temporal. And you talk to John Hogenesch right now, and he\\'s telling you the importance of chronomedicine or chromo pharma... Whatever the word is. And it really just getting the drugs at the right time of the day is going to be essential for our health. - Do you think that\\'s going to come from using better trackers, like Oura rings, WHOOP straps, these kinds of things? - I love the trackers, but I think there\\'s even more exciting discoveries. Now you could take a single blood sample and measure many biological components and figure where you are in the circadian clock. Something that was very hard to do before. So if you have a marker to know where you are in the clock, you could actually understand more the effect of everything; exercise, feeding, light input. - What is the marker? - So there are some papers from what\\'s her name? Phyllis Zee and from Achim Kramer where they measure multiple RNAs that are known to tell you what phase of the clock is, or multiple proteins or biological reactions. And depending on a combination of factors, not a single factor, you could tell where you are in the circadian clock. So they could instead of just measuring temperature or melatonin, just one measurement. And melatonin specifically, is also complicated by the fact that melatonin is affected by light. And temperature, your temperature and sleep can be easily dissociable, right? When you travel up those different timezone, you sleep at different times in the temperature cycle. So having multiple components measured will give you a better determination of your circadian phase, and understanding your circadian phase in humans will telling you what is the effect of giving certain drugs at certain times of the circadian phase. So, in the future, this is going to be studied at a much higher level when you can determine the phase in relation to all the other stuff. - It\\'s striking to me that in all animals, besides humans, if they deviate too much from the appropriate exposure to light and light-dark cycle, they essentially don\\'t mate and/or die and/or get killed off. But in humans, we are able to override that at least to some extent, but the ways in which we suffer appear to be things like obesity, metabolic syndromes, reproductive syndromes that are accompany the other syndromes, you know, endocrine syndromes, and mood and depressive disorders. Is there any effort at the level of the nationally or laboratories that you\\'re aware of to try and use light in order to improve mood and mental health? - I mean, honestly, this is my mantra. This is the thing that I think people, because I say, don\\'t take a pill, take a photon. And not, I mean, you take pills. That\\'s important. I\\'m just making it that really we have an opportunity right now with the incredible advances of LED lights, of changing spectrum of light, of regulating intensities. And just for simple changes, you could really improve sleep-wake cycle, productivity, and still you could actually get more done because as we\\'ve talked about, when you have all these messed up, now you have to sleep more, but your sleep is fragmented. It\\'s not very good. - And you can\\'t focus when you do sit down- - And you can\\'t focus or you don\\'t have alertness when you need the alertness. So having all these could allow you to do even more actually at the end than less. And that\\'s the exciting part it. - One of the questions I get asked most often about is about ADHD. I think there\\'s a lot of self-prescribed as well as clinically prescribed ADHD. People are having a tremendously difficult time focusing and not just because they\\'re sleepy, they just can\\'t seem to anchor their attention. And there could be multiple reasons for this, but there are now several clinical trials ongoing using light to try and anchor people\\'s attention and mood and wellbeing for sake of focus. And I think that while I love this saying that you mentioned, \"Take a photon, not a pill.\" And with due respect to the need for pharmacology for some certain people, I think most people just haven\\'t really dialed in their relationship to light in a way that allows them to rule out whether or not they need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely. That\\'s the best way to put it. I can\\'t add to that. - Let\\'s talk about jet lag. - Mm hm. - But not in the context of, okay, if somebody\\'s traveling from Europe to Japan or from the east coast, because that varies tremendously, right? I mean, there\\'s as many different variations on travel as there are individuals out there with roles- - Right. - And jobs, et cetera. But rather, let\\'s talk about what are the two or three things that people can do to adjust their schedule quickly? Yesterday, I called you and said, \"Look, I know somebody who\\'s traveling six hours. I won\\'t even mention in which direction, \\'cause I don\\'t want people to anchor to that example. And you described some very simple tools of viewing light a little bit earlier than normal and getting on the local food schedule, et cetera, that would allow them to shift more quickly. - Exactly. - And the reason I want to have this conversation is yes, for the travelers, and for the shift workers, but mostly because of the fact that you\\'ve proven again and again that people are disrupted in their circadian behavior at home. So, aside from what we\\'ve already talked about, how can one adjust quickly to a new schedule? Like let\\'s say, fall classes are starting, you start a new job or you have a baby or a puppy or whatever, what is the best way to shift the clock quickly? - So, it\\'s very simple as we\\'ve talked yesterday. So imagine you\\'re in the outside with no industrial light. If your body thinks you\\'re in early evening and you see a bright light, what does this tell you? Oh, wait, this is not early evening yet. It\\'s still early afternoon or late afternoon. So I have to delay my clock to go back to late afternoon. So if you get light early in the evening, it delays your clock. So what does that- - Meaning that makes you want to go to sleep later? - Yes, it delays your clock. So, you\\'re in New York, right? People in Italy have an advanced clock because they are six hours ahead of us. So if you\\'re in New York and you get light early in the evening, you delay even further from Italy. So now you\\'re delaying away from Italy. Now the same thing happens. Let\\'s say, you thought dawn came up and you thought it\\'s already dawn, but it was let\\'s say three o\\'clock in the morning or four o\\'clock in the morning. And then you get to bright light and you say, \"Oh, wait a minute. Dawn is not the up yet.\" So I should advance my clock. Or I\\'m at night, but I\\'m getting bright lights, so I should run because dawn is already up. So then later in the night, later in your night, and actually it just happens that in humans you get a temperature nadir later in the night, low temperature in your body. After that, lights start advancing your clock. So if you want to go to Italy, instead of getting light early in the evening, you want to get light after the temperature low. So you could advance your clock even before you go to Italy, and you\\'re catching up to the Italians just by using light. It\\'s as simple as that. - Great. - So you could do it for every region. You could calculate how much they are advanced of you. You could know how much these light shifts happen per day, and you can calculate what you need to do, very simple math, to adjust either in direction of delaying if you\\'re going from New York to California, you want to delay your clock or advancing if you\\'re going from New York to Italy. - So, in order to make that a visual and because a lot of people are listening to this, not looking at it on video, we will put a zero cost downloadable figure of this on the HubermanLab.com website related to this episode. But I think I can summarize it in language as well. If I understand correctly, what you\\'re saying is if your typical wake up time is say, 7:00 a.m., then your low point in temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. - Yeah. - And if you view light right around then it\\'s going to essentially advance your clock. - Yeah. Because then your body thinks, oh, it\\'s seven o\\'clock, so advanced your clock by one to two hours. - But if I were to view light, say at 3:00 a.m., then it would probably delay my clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, and then let\\'s say I land in a new schedule. I want to adjust to a new schedule. Let\\'s say I didn\\'t manage to do anything with my light viewing before I went. And I didn\\'t anticipate the trip. Suddenly I\\'m on a new schedule, okay? I was told that one of the ways to help shift the clock and to avoid gastrointestinal issues is to eat on the local schedule. - Mm hm. - To start basically behaving like a local. - Mm hm. - Even though your circadian clock will take a little bit of time to catch up. - Right, absolutely. But you have to remember the light, right? So, now that we explained it very simply, let\\'s take a very simple example, right? New York to Italy, that\\'s a simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right? So let\\'s say you fly from New York at night. You reach Italy at eight o\\'clock in the morning. What is the time in your New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back. - It\\'s 2:00 in the morning. - It\\'s 2:00 a.m.. So when you land Italy, you want to avoid light like the plague. Yeah, you could eat, but you really don\\'t want to get the light. - Right, \\'cause otherwise it\\'s going to delay you. - It\\'s going to delay you, it\\'s going to send you to California instead of sending you to Italy. - Right, and so this is such a key point. If anyone\\'s confused about this, we will put some diagrams up. But what Samer is saying is so crucial. Just because getting bright light in your eyes early in the day is really beneficial when you\\'re at home, when you travel to a new time zone, you have to take into account what your body thinks. Excuse me, you have to take into account where your body thinks you are. - Exactly. - And so if you\\'re looking at the Italian sunrise, having just flown from New York to Italy and you didn\\'t prepare for that trip by waking up a little bit earlier in anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - And you view light at 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, you are going to delay your clock. You\\'re going to basically throw yourself back to California, but you are in Italy. You\\'re going to throw your biology back to California and you are going to be up in the middle of the Italian night. And you\\'re going to be miserable- - Miserable. - I\\'ll tell a brief anecdote \\'cause I called Samer in desperation. A few years ago, I traveled to Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi to give a seminar, 12 hours out of phase. It\\'s a 12 hour flip. And I thought I could just muscle it. I thought I\\'ll get up, just view sunlight when the sun comes up and I fell apart mentally and physically. And Samer came to my rescue. I called him, I said, \"I don\\'t know what to do.\" And he said, \"Go to the gym at the local dawn, workout, eat and then view sunlight starting the next day.\" And that basically got me on the schedule. So I used food and exercise to adjust myself because my light viewing activity was just completely out of whack. - Yeah, I mean, and we talked about other details, so you have to calculate it, but you\\'re absolutely right. I mean, it\\'s very important to avoid getting the wrong light information when you\\'re trying to adjust your body because otherwise it shifts you to the other cycle, absolutely right. - Well, you are one of these people that has such vigor. It\\'s one of these things where having known you all these years, you have a tremendous capacity for work and for soccer, and for arguing, respectful arguing. And sometimes, you know- - It\\'s getting worse with age. - Yeah, well, we could talk about that offline, but I think a lot of your vigor and a lot of your ability to work hard and focus and really do so many things at an impressive level is because you think about these issues and you think about when you\\'re going to be optimal for focus, when you\\'re going to be optimal for exercise, and the when is the key. - Right. - And I think a lot of people live in the landscape of feeling like there\\'s something broken inside them because they can\\'t focus- - It\\'s subconscious. - Or they get too- - It\\'s subconscious, right? Remember it\\'s all subconscious. These effects and, Andrew, you\\'re absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside about age, I really agree with you that I think part of the reason I\\'m continuing to be able to do this, that I really think about it. And I make sure that I keep everything aligned. And that actually helps me a lot. Like I don\\'t suffer in sleep. I don\\'t suffer in waking up. I never use a timer to wake up. I mean, people say, aren\\'t you scared? Like you have to give a lecture at 8:00 or 7:30. Honestly, I was like, there is no way I\\'m going to go beyond that. It just, even if I try, I can\\'t sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. in my regular times, it\\'s just, it\\'s not going to happen. By 4:30 my eyes are wide awake and I\\'m in bed. It\\'s just system is so aligned, it works. - A lot of times people will say, how come I go to sleep, I fall asleep fine, but then I wake up at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning and can\\'t fall back asleep. Is it possible that those people were supposed to go to bed at 8:00 p.m.? - It\\'s possible. I mean, it is possible. It is also possible that sometimes people will wake up and go back to sleep. But yeah, I mean, it is possible. Or it\\'s possible that their clock is completely misaligned, that they are getting maybe a nap time at night when they are supposed... And then they possibly feel so sleepy in the day. So, all these are possible combination. - Well, that\\'s an interesting idea I hadn\\'t considered. So, that what they think is their sleep, their body is so out of whack with the light-dark cycle, that it\\'s actually a nap. - A nap. Or the weaker part of the sleep. I mean, you see this when you traveled to different time zone before you adjust. You go to sleep really well, but two hours later, you\\'re fully up. Two hours. If you were so tired and this is your regular sleep, there\\'s no way you\\'re going to wake up in two hours. So, then you feel very sleepy later in the day or something like that. So it depends of how your whole system is aligned to the environment. - That\\'s a very interesting idea. I think that\\'s going to resonate with a lot of people. I wake up every morning around 3:00 or 4:00, I generally use the bathroom and then I fall back asleep very deeply. It doesn\\'t seem to disrupt my daytime wakefulness. And I think a lot of people obsess over that waking up and worry there\\'s something wrong. - Absolutely. - Provided they can go back to sleep it\\'s okay. - Exactly. If you can go use the bathroom, go back to sleep, that should not be a problem. Maybe with some people, when they go to use the bathroom, they use very bright light and then they get an alerting signal. So, maybe it could be as simple as that, that affects you. Maybe when you wake up, you put tons of light or you start reading your iPad. So there\\'s all these combination that we still don\\'t know about that could be affecting their sleep-wake rhythms and their sleep maintenance. - Do you take melatonin? - I don\\'t need it to be honest. In my case, there is no reason to use it because I could guarantee you that by maybe eight o\\'clock, my melatonin has already started to go up. And by the time I sleep, my melatonin is very high because I don\\'t use a lot of lights after sunset. - And light inhibits melatonin release. - And light really blocks melatonin level. - You hear this myth that the pineal gland calcifies as we get older. Do you know anything about that? - I mean, I\\'ve heard about that, but I don\\'t know... I mean, there is not very clear evidence that it affects the sleep. I don\\'t know much about it, to be honest. - Yeah, the evidence that I\\'ve seen is that yes, there\\'s some calcification around the pineal, just because of where it sits in the brain. It\\'s close to some bony structures. - I see. - But I don\\'t think there\\'s any evidence that it has negative effects. - I mean, if you still have, you could measure melatonin and that should tell you if it has any, it\\'s such an easy thing to do. - Yeah, I think this is more of a internet wellness thing that got outside the cage. - That\\'s possible. I think you\\'re absolutely right. - Yeah, it sounds terrible, calcification of the thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like the heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Let\\'s talk about seasonality a little bit. I learned, and I don\\'t know if this is still true, but that most suicides occur in April, in the spring. I think there\\'s a poem that says, \"April is the cruelest month,\" I think as the poem begins. Are there data that suicides are more frequent at particular times of year? And if so, is the spring that time of year? - Yeah, a lot of people talk about this. And one of the hypothesis is that the winter month that are very bad for mood, make people not wanting to do anything. And they get into such deep level of depression that when the sun comes up, they get actually the energy to act on their depression, which sounds really terrible. And it\\'s just terrible. - Sounds just terrible. It\\'s terrible. - So that\\'s the idea that the lack of light throughout the winter caused them to go into such depression that they don\\'t feel like doing anything. Then when the light comes in with rigor in the spring, it gives them that after all the depression they suffered, it gives them that push to take that sad, final act I guess. - What other seasonal effects have been demonstrated in humans? - Yeah, I mean, I think in humans, it\\'s not very clear because we don\\'t think about seasonality, but if you start thinking about us, I think we go through major seasonal changes. I really do. I think our eating pattern changed across the year. I could tell you that me thinking about this, there is a clear changes that happens to me across the year. But for animals, this is really essential because for animals they have to time their mating behavior was when they deliver their progeny in the most abundant amount of food and artificial light is causing major disruption. Because if you change the way these animals are receiving the light information, they either start mating much earlier or much later and their numbers dwindle. And they get into the dangers of really completely getting eliminated or extinct. - Well, human birth rates are definitely going down. - Right, in some- - I mean, in the US in particular, yeah. - In some areas, not others. - Not others, right. But are there other effects of seasonality on humans that we are aware of? - Honestly, you could see it perfectly, I think, in Scandinavia, I mean, you could talk to people who live in- - Sure, they get seasonal depression. - Well, seasonal depression is one, but actually when you start asking them questions, they tell you like in the winter they barely could wake up. They barely have the energy, before even depression. Even people who don\\'t get seasonal depression, they will tell you our energy level is lower. Our ability to go to work is not the same. And in the summer, most people actually sleep very little. They tell you, we really can feel like we\\'re manic, we have all this energy and not in a negative way, in a funny way, right? I mean, but if we want to sleep, we have to put this curtain. And I think in these situations, you could really appreciate the seasonality of humans. I think we kind of destroyed our seasonality because we don\\'t get exposed to that much natural light. We have all this artificial light, but I think honestly, one of the thing that is going to happen if they follow your recommendations about giving light at the same time, giving food, giving exercise- - Wait, let\\'s be clear, those are your recommendations. - Well, I mean- - No, I mean just in fair attribution. - What I\\'m saying is that this is going to cause them to also experience some changes across the season, because now they\\'re going to see the sun differently. If you\\'re going to go out in the morning in the summer, you\\'re going to get a much brighter... That\\'s why I don\\'t like the change in time. I know people think, oh, because you\\'re biased, \\'cause I think- - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Sorry, the change in time, are you talking about daylight savings? - Daylight savings. It\\'s such a bad idea because it disrupts that rhythm that you\\'re having. \\'Cause I think your body, if you keep that rhythm, you will see the whole seasonality. And I look at it from a different aspect than other people. And people say I\\'m biased because I\\'m a morning person, and it may be true, but there are situation- - Secret conspiracy about morning people. - Yeah, but if you think about it, Andrew, there is a situation where you\\'re getting light perfectly well and then all of a sudden they delayed by one hour because... And then even though it\\'s the summer, your body now, if you\\'re still not adjusting think, \"Oh wait, what happened? What kind of happened?\" - Well, I\\'m glad you\\'re bringing this up because I always thought what\\'s the big deal, one hour? Right, one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - It\\'s so hard to adjust to one hour actually. - But this goes back to the beginning of our discussion. It\\'s not just one hour. - Right. - Because it\\'s one hour across that one day. - Right. - But there\\'s this cumulative effect on the clock and these three elements of your tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, the homeostatic, sleep and the light, direct effects on mood. - Exactly and when it\\'s so close, it\\'s sometimes hard to figure out how to adjust it perfectly because we\\'re already sleep deprived in our society. And then you shift it by... So it just, it all accumulates and it has no benefit. - Well, you work at a major government organization, National Institute of Mental Health. - Yeah. - Why don\\'t we campaign for- - Honestly, I have no idea. I mean, it makes no sense. - No, I\\'m saying why don\\'t we go campaign? - Yeah, I would love to. I mean, it makes no sense to have the summer light goes up at 9:00 p.m., the light goes down where I live in Baltimore at 9:00 p.m. And then all of a sudden, when you really want to see the light longer in the day, you now shift the other way. And now it goes all of a sudden at 6:00 p.m.. Why do you do these drastic changes? Let it blend across the whole season, you know? Yes, later, earlier at night, but it\\'s at least consistent. It goes in a very consistent manner. I just don\\'t understand why they do this. It makes no sense. - Well, I think that the reason they do it is because they don\\'t understand the biology. - Exactly, absolutely. - Because one hour seems trivial unless you understand- - It\\'s not. - That the repercussions of that one hour shift, because what\\'s also clear now based on what you\\'re saying, is that that one hour shift taking you out of alignment with the natural light-dark cycle in exactly the wrong direction. - It\\'s pushing people to get even later. - Yeah. - In the summer, when light is going to push you later anyway. It doesn\\'t make sense. You put it beautifully, I just rambled and this is really- - No, no, you made it clear. - I mean, it\\'s like literally it it made people who are having problem having an advanced sleep rhythm because they are delayed, now you give them this hour to make them even more delayed. You push them even later in the day-night cycle. It just doesn\\'t make sense at all. - I think 2022 should be the year that we abolish daylight savings. - Oh, man. That would be the day for me honestly. - Well, also, if it has a positive effect on what is essentially an epidemic of mental health issues and other issues related to improper interactions with light, that I think is a well worthwhile cause, and we can explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] So for once we\\'re going to fight with another group. - Common, I would do to do that. - [Andrew] A common battle as opposed to with one another. - I mean, the circadian people honestly, to give them credit, have been trying for years to abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, the problem is they all go to sleep at 9:00 p.m. and wake up at 4:00 a.m., so we never see them. - That\\'s right, that\\'s right. - No, the circadian community has done an amazing job of figuring out what we need. - Right. - And then the challenge of course, is making sure that people get what they need. - Right. - And making sure that at a societal level, we\\'re not vaulting ourselves into the wrong direction. - And the biggest problem is that the late waking people, they think that really, and I\\'m going to try to put it in a better way now, they think, oh, because you\\'re a morning person, you want to see the sun early. So you want me to suffer it dropping late, but that\\'s not the case. Because what happens is when they shift it back after the daylight saving, now they\\'re going to make you suffer really badly because now it\\'s going to be earlier. - Right, in the fall. - In the fall when there is not enough light. - Yeah, that\\'s right. - And they keep it the same way. So to try to convince them that actually this at the end causes more trouble when you need the light for your late schedule in the fall, when they shift it back. Then they say, keep it daylight saving all the time. And that has been proven that it\\'s very bad. Like people have done studies that literally two areas close to each others and areas that were the whole year on daylight saving has much more problems even in cancer rates and depression. So you don\\'t want to do that. So that\\'s what trying to convince people that you need to prevent that switch, and you don\\'t need daylight saving at all. That\\'s where the problem happens. - Interesting. I had not thought about that, but yes, you late risers that in the fall, when it\\'s the fall back, as they say, spring forward, fall back, you dial back the clock, it\\'s really compounding the problem that already exists. - Exactly. And it\\'s really nice if you think, if you keep it consistent in the spring, you get the equinox and then the day starts going up, and then even in the summer it start going down, and then the fall you get the other equinox and go back. So it\\'s very symmetrical, right? It goes into short day, longer, long, long, long, long, and then short day again. But now you\\'re getting these bumps in both sides of the spring and fall. Why would you do that? Something that is beautifully symmetrical, beautifully smooth, you\\'re putting bumps into it. - Well, and not just beautiful because it\\'s there, but it evolved. I mean, essentially this is the system- - It\\'s natural. - We evolved in for hundreds of thousands of years. - This is the seasonality. The most even apart from the exact equator, every part of the earth has seasonality. - I want to briefly touch on something which is individual and genetic variation in the sensitivity to light. - Yeah. - So not chronotype, but first of all, a very basic question. Do people with light eyes, light colored eyes, are they more sensitive to light than people with darker pigmented eyes? - I mean, honestly, it makes sense they will be more because if you think of my dark pupil, it\\'s blocking more light. So, if you have light pupil, yes, for vision, it may not be very obvious, but for something that is measuring the amount of light, you\\'re getting more light than me. So you would probably need less light to be effective as somebody who\\'s darker. And that maybe could explain why sometimes lighter people say, I don\\'t want to go into very bright conditions because it\\'s really bright. - Yeah, I can\\'t even be at a cafe with one of these reflective tables, like a metal table. - Right. - Unless I have very dark sunglasses on. - Exactly. - It\\'s so bright it\\'s painful for me. - Right, right. - Whereas some people like you, we\\'ve sat outside and had meals and you\\'re like fine. I assumed it was kind of Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, it\\'s really the pupil blocks more light. So I think it is possible that it\\'s as simple as the pupil blocking more light can have sensitivity, but your question is also goes deeper. Are there more sensitivity differences? And my understanding would be I would think that it may be, depends on how effective your cells are in responding to light, how healthy your ipRCGs are. But there\\'s not many studies to show that. What is really clear that is happening is that patients with bipolar, they seem to have different sensitivities to light. So it seems that at least people who have psychological changes, they may have differences to the sensitivity of light, so. - Are those differences in a particular direction? - I don\\'t remember the exact data. - We can look it up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - And people have heard me say this at nauseum to the point where they actually roll their eyes, but that these are the only two pieces of brain, I\\'m pointing to my eyes, folks, that are outside the cranial vault. - Absolutely. - They are two pieces of brain that it basically inform the brain about whether or not to be alert or asleep. - Absolutely. - But you can imagine that those two little pieces of brain that we call eyes would have genetic variations. - Right. - Of course eye color is genetically determined, that there would be genetic variations based on whether or not your ancestry evolved near the equator or further from the equator, right? I mean, you see more blue eyes in Scandinavia, than you do at the equator. - Absolutely, I mean, it\\'s the lack of light that said you need less inhibition because there\\'s not enough light, right? So that\\'s the idea of the changing color. So, yeah, I totally agree with you. I mean, I think this is an area that will be studied later and will be empirically determined. The problem we have in this field right now, which I think is the biggest problem, is we don\\'t have a way to measure the ipRCGs sensitivities in humans. So we still like, it\\'s easy to measure your rod cone function if you go to an optometrist, they measure all the details, right? Contrast detection. - You look at the chart, you get out the Snellen Chart. - Yeah, exactly. - You look at the letters of the DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - But for the non subconscious, we still don\\'t have a good measuring systems to figure out what is Andrew\\'s sensitivity? What is Samer\\'s sensitivity? What is this person\\'s sensitivity? And I think we\\'re starting to work on something like that to hopefully develop these techniques. But till we develop them, it\\'s going to be very hard to figure out if there is a sensitivity difference? How do they relate? And on men and woman? Dark and light? And all that, normal versus psychologically affect, and stuff like that. - Fascinating. And every time you talk, I learn so much. It\\'s in the best way, the best sense of the term, it\\'s a waterfall of knowledge. As a final question, I have a question about sensitivity of a whole other kind, and that\\'s the sensitivity to spicy food. Now, the reason I\\'m asking this question, what seemingly out of the blue is that I made the mistake once of having Samer cook for me. And I said, \"Not too spicy.\" And he said, \"Okay, not too spicy.\" He actually said, \"Okay, not too spicy.\" And it almost killed me. Like it was like two or three days. So you know a lot about biology outside the visual system, light, et cetera. You\\'ve been around a while. Are there known genetic or inherited of any kind sensitivities to spicy food? To things like red peppers and capsaicin? Because what you call mild, my friend, almost put me into the hospital. - I think this is similar to you swimming in the ocean and I need to go develop the pain tolerance to do it. - Okay, true, true, I like cold water swims and Samer\\'s not a fan. - Yeah. - But that\\'s going to change. It\\'s adaptable. - These are adaptable. - That\\'s going to change. - That\\'s my belief. Before I met Rejji, I was like you. And once I started eating a lot of spicy food, I lost touch of how spicy my food is. So I nearly killed you, Andrew, and I apologize for that. - I forgive you. So, basically what you\\'re saying is that marriage toughened you up? - Toughened me up, exactly. - [Andrew] Maybe that\\'s the solution. - That\\'s what you need, yeah. - Samer, this has been an amazing march through the importance of light, not just for regulating sleep and wakefulness, but also for food timing, the interactions with mood, the interactions with exercise. I\\'m certain that people are going to start thinking about how to change their relationship with light as a way to anchor everything that they do. And that\\'s important to their health. And I just on behalf of all of them, and just directly from me as your friend and as a colleague for many years now, I just want to say, thank you for the incredible work you\\'re doing and for sharing it with us. - Thank you so much. And I actually now thinking about all of this, and you said, I should write a book. I should write a book and call it \"The Tripartite Model.\" I think that would put all these components together, it would be very interesting to do at some point. - You should write a book. They\\'ll probably try and change the title to like, \"Food, Mood and You,\" or something. But you can put in little print The Tripartite Model or whatever, but regardless of what it\\'s called, you absolutely should write a book. And so if you\\'d like Samer to write a book, or if you\\'d like to learn more about him, let\\'s talk a little bit about where people can find you. Your laboratory is at the National Institutes of Mental Health. He is Head of the Chronobiology Unit, all these things as I\\'ve mentioned earlier, but you are active on Twitter and Instagram. - Right. - So, what is your Twitter handle? - It\\'s @SamerHattar. - And we will provide a link for that in the show notes. - Yes, the Twitter @SamerHattar, and I think the same for Instagram. Yeah, actually. - And Samer has been coaxed onto Instagram, so he does post from time to time, mostly pictures of food that is incredibly spicy, but also information about chronobiology. He comes on for an Instagram Live every once in a while with me. So, definitely give him a follow there and on Twitter. And I\\'m sure that he\\'ll be happy to answer questions and entertain any and all discussions about chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. And light, yeah. - Great, thank you, Samer. - Awesome, thank you, Andrew. - Thank you for joining me for my conversation with Dr. Samer Hattar. I hope you found it as interesting and informative as I did. If you\\'re enjoying this podcast and/or learning from it, please subscribe to our YouTube channel.

[bright music] I\\'m Andrew Huberman and I\\'m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today we\\'re talking all about sleep and how to optimize your sleep. This is a topic we\\'ve covered previously on this podcast in the episode called \"Master Your Sleep.\" However, since the airing of that episode, there\\'s been some terrific new science to come out. I\\'ve also received thousands, yes, literally thousands of questions related to the specific protocols covered in that episode as well as in the episode on jet lag and shift work. And while today\\'s episode is not specifically about jet lag and shift work, we are going to cover tools that will allow you to shift your schedule if you need to for work or travel, and we will also cover tools that will allow you to fall back asleep if you happen to wake up in the middle of the night or if you get a poor night\\'s sleep, how to actually recover from that poor night\\'s sleep more quickly, and yes, indeed, even replace sleep that you\\'ve lost. So today\\'s episode is going to be filled with practical tools. We will touch on some of the underlying science, but it\\'s really designed to be a practical toolkit for optimizing your sleep depending on your specific sleep needs. Various times throughout today\\'s episode, I will refer to studies that form the backbone of the tools that I\\'ll be describing. But whereas most of the podcast episodes here tend to be deep scientific mechanism and then tools, scientific mechanism, then tools, today I\\'m mainly going to focus on the practical tools that anyone, indeed, all people, I believe, should use in order to optimize their sleep. Why should everybody want to optimize their sleep and put considerable effort into optimizing their sleep? Well, put simply, sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance of all kinds, cognitive performance, physical performance, et cetera. It also controls things like our immune system, wound healing, our skin health and our appearance, whether or not we can think clearly or not, whether or not we will live as long as we possibly can or not, whether or not we suffer from dramatic age-related cognitive decline or not. In other words, whether or not we keep our memory as we age. I could go on and on about all the terrible things that can happen to somebody if they don\\'t sleep well. Thanks to the great work of Professor Matt Walker at University of California, Berkeley, and the wonderful book that he wrote, \"Why We Sleep,\" I think the world is largely onboard now that sleep is critical to our health, our mental health, our physical health, and our performance, but what\\'s not often discussed is how great life is, that is, how much more focused and energetic and how positive our mood gets, when we are sleeping for the appropriate amount of time at the appropriate depth and when we are doing that regularly. Basically everything in life gets better when we\\'re sleeping well. So today I\\'m going to teach you the tools that will allow you to optimize your sleep. That is, get to sleep and stay asleep, fall back asleep if you wake up in the middle of the night, and adjust your sleep given the various life demands you may be experiencing. I\\'m pleased to announce that The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered with Momentous supplements. We partnered with Momentous for several important reasons. First of all, they ship internationally, because we know that many of you are located outside of the United States. That\\'s valuable. Second of all, and perhaps most important, the quality of their supplements is second to none, both in terms of purity and precision of the amounts of the ingredients. Third, we\\'ve really emphasized supplements that are single- ingredient supplements and that are supplied in dosages that allow you to build a supplementation protocol that\\'s optimized for cost, that\\'s optimized for effectiveness, and that you can add things and remove things from your protocol in a way that\\'s really systematic and scientific. This is really hard to do if you\\'re taking blends of different supplements or if the dosages are such that you can\\'t titrate, or that is, adjust the dosages of a given supplement. So by using single-ingredient supplements, you can really build out the supplement kit that\\'s ideal for you and your specific needs. If you\\'d like to see the supplements that we partner with Momentous on, you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman. There you\\'ll see those supplements. And just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding the library of supplements available through Momentous on a regular basis. Again, that\\'s livemomentous.com/huberman. Before we begin, I\\'d like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I\\'d like to thank the sponsors of today\\'s podcast. Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better meet your health goals. I\\'ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA test, you can also get insight into, for instance, what your biological age is and compare that to your chronological age. And, of course, your biological age is really the age that counts. The problem with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about the levels of metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera, but you don\\'t know what to do with that information. InsideTracker makes that all very easy to navigate. They have a personalized platform. So this is a web portal where you can go, you\\'ll see the numbers from your blood tests and DNA tests, and then it will tell you, for instance, how you could adjust various aspects of your nutrition or your exercise or supplementation in order to bring those numbers into the ranges that are best for you.

Today\\'s episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capabilities. It turns out that your body temperature and your ability to fall and stay asleep are very closely related. If your body does not drop by one to three degrees, you are simply not going to get into deep sleep or stay in deep sleep. And waking up, it also turns out, is related to body temperature. Every time you wake up in the morning, your body is warming up in order to wake you up, and this has an enormous number of hormonal and metabolic and other cascades that are vitally important, not just to what happens while you sleep, but your health and your energy and focus throughout the day. Eight Sleep is an incredible device. It\\'s one that I\\'ve been using for six months or so, and it\\'s completely transformed my sleep. And I already thought I was sleeping pretty well. The way it works is that you can cool or heat your mattress according to different times throughout the night. So for instance, you can cool your mattress if you tend to run warm and that will help you fall and stay deeply asleep and then toward morning, you can have the mattress programmed or, I should say, the mattress cover programmed, so that you warm up your sleeping environment and you wake up when you want to wake up. If you\\'ve been sleeping pretty well but waking up in the middle of the night, you might also find that by cooling your mattress even further toward the middle of your sleep about, well, you\\'ll stay in deep sleep much longer.

LMNT is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need in order to get your brain and body to function at its best, but none of the things you don\\'t, in particular, sugar. Electrolytes are vitally important to the way that your neurons, your nerve cells, work and, indeed, to the way that all the cells of your body work. But your nervous system and your neurons particularly depend on electrolytes because you need the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium, in the proper ratios, in order for those nerve cells to fire what are called action potentials, which are the electrical signals that allow your neurons to work and to allow you to do everything from remembering information to moving your muscles deliberately. When you exercise, or even if you don\\'t, you can get quite low on electrolytes, especially on a hot day. You can get dehydrated. There are lot of different ways to replenish your fluids and electrolytes and there are a lot of different electrolyte drinks out there, but many of them contain a lot of sugar. And some of those that don\\'t contain a lot of sugar don\\'t have the proper ratios of sodium, magnesium, and potassium. If you\\'d like to try LMNT, you can go to drinklmnt, that\\'s L-M-N-T, .com/huberman to claim a free LMNT Sample Pack with your first purchase. Again, that\\'s drinklmnt.com/huberman to claim a free sample pack. Let\\'s talk about sleep and tools to optimize your sleep. I want you to conceptualize yourself as contained within a room that has only very few windows or very few entry points. What do I mean by this? Well, your brain and your nervous system control whether or not you move or don\\'t move. They control whether or not you\\'re digesting food or you\\'re not digesting food. They control whether or not you\\'re stressed or not stressed, happy or sad, et cetera. All of that stuff that controls all that stuff is housed inside your skin and skull, et cetera. That might seem pretty obvious, but what that means is that for your brain and body to feel alert and focused, ready to move and exercise or do some work, or if your brain body are going to lie down and go to sleep, well, that brain and body needs cues, it needs inputs, to determine when to do those different things. And those cues and inputs arrive through a defined set of what I\\'ll call stimuli, but you can also think of these as levers or tools. The main levers and tools that are going to allow you to control when you are awake and when you are asleep and to get better sleep every single night are light, literally photons, light energy, could be from sunlight, could be from artificial light, we will discuss those particulars in a moment, as well as darkness. That is the absence of light. So we\\'ve got light and dark. Those are two very powerful tools to encourage your nervous system to be in one state or another, meaning awake or asleep. Temperature is another tool or lever. Turns out that when your body is cooling down, you have a greater tendency to fall and stay asleep. In fact, every night when you actually sleep, your body is dropping by one to three degrees and that drop in temperature is required. It\\'s like a gate that your body has to go through in order for you to get into sleep. And in fact, the converse is also true. If your body heats up by one to three degrees or so, you will wake up. So you\\'ve got light, dark, temperature, food. And when we say food, we mean what we eat, when we eat, and the amount that we eat. Okay, so light, dark, temperature, food, exercise. And of course, exercise comes in different forms. We can do cardiovascular exercise that can be low-intensity, long-distance exercise. It can be high intensity, so-called high intensity interval training. It could be weight training. It could be yoga. It could be swimming, any number of different activities. But exercise, in general, causes an increase in body temperature and tends to make us more alert, not just during the exercise, but in the immediate hours after that exercise. Exercise does some other things that relate to our sleep as well and we\\'ll talk about those today and how you can leverage them. Another potent lever for adjusting your sleepiness and wakefulness is caffeine. This, of course, comes as no surprise to people, but why and how caffeine works might come as a surprise. Very briefly, we have a molecule in our body called adenosine and the longer we have been awake, the more adenosine builds up in our brain and body and adenosine is part of the reason why we get sleepy. Caffeine effectively operates as a adenosine antagonist. It works by basically occupying the receptor for adenosine. So it\\'s a little bit of a convoluted mechanism. But basically all you need to know is that caffeine prevents the actions of adenosine. That\\'s one of the reasons why caffeine makes us feel alert. But how much caffeine we drink and when we drink caffeine turns out to be vitally important for adjusting our wakefulness and for optimizing our sleep. So we\\'ll talk about that as well. The other category of lever or tools which are immensely powerful for optimizing sleep are supplements. There now exist as many as eight different supplements that can powerfully modulate sleep in healthy ways and that have huge margins for safety. So we\\'re going to talk about what those supplements are. In previous episodes of this podcast and as a guest on other podcasts, I\\'ve talked about three particular supplements, magnesium threonate, apigenin, and theanine, which together can really enhance the speed at which one falls asleep and people\\'s ability to stay asleep and to really get into those deep stages of sleep that are particularly restorative. Today we\\'re going to talk a little bit more about each of those three and how they can best be used in combination, but we are also going to touch on some other supplements that I have not talked about much before, if at all. Things like glycine and GABA, as well as inositol. Many people are going to find inositol interesting and of particular use to them, especially if they\\'re following a low-carbohydrate diet or if they are fasting before sleep or just trying to avoid eating too close to bedtime and yet they\\'re having a hard time falling asleep. Inositol also turns out to be especially useful for people who have a tendency to wake up in the middle of the night and have a hard time falling back asleep. It also has some interesting and potent effects on anxiety throughout the day. So we\\'re going to talk about inositol as a tool as well. And then last in our list of general categories of levers and tools for optimizing sleep are digital tools. Now, when we say digital tools, I don\\'t necessarily mean devices. What I mean are things like non- sleep deep rest scripts. These are zero-cost scripts that you listen to that take your body through some deep relaxation and that can help people both fall asleep, stay asleep, fall back asleep, and get better at sleeping. And also going to talk about digital tools related to self-hypnosis. This is distinctly different from stage hypnosis. So I know some of you hear hypnosis and you think, oh, you know, people clucking like chickens and doing things that are outside their control. That\\'s not at all what I\\'m referring to here. I\\'m talking about clinically and research-supported tools that have been shown to enhance people\\'s ability to fall and stay asleep and that can get you far better at sleeping. So again, to recap the list of levers and tools, we\\'ve got light and dark, and that includes the intensity of light, the timing of light, et cetera. We\\'ve got temperature. We have food. We have exercise, caffeine, supplements, and digital tools, not just limited to devices, but zero- cost tools that you can access on YouTube and elsewhere in various apps that can really help you optimize your sleep. So today we\\'re going to talk about all of these. I really want to provide you as many tools as possible, give you the logic behind each of those tools and when and how best to apply them so that you can develop the sleep toolkit that\\'s ideal for your sleep needs. As we head into our description of tools for optimizing sleep, let\\'s consider what the perfect 24-hour cycle would look like. Let\\'s start this 24-hour cycle with when you wake up in the morning. So for some of you, that will be 5:00 a.m. For others of you, that will be 10:00 a.m. Most people, I believe, wake up sometime between 6:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. But regardless of when you wake up in the morning, one of the first things that happens is that your body temperature is increasing and that\\'s just going to happen naturally. Some of it is going to be the consequence of your moving around a bit, but really the increase in body temperature is one of the main triggers for why you woke up in the first place. That increase in body temperature in turn causes an increase in the release of a hormone called cortisol. Cortisol is often discussed as a stress hormone, but it\\'s not just associated with stress. It also enhances your immune system provided cortisol is elevated at the right times, and the right time for cortisol to be elevated is when you first wake up in the morning. That increase in cortisol is also going to increase metabolism. It\\'s also going to increase your ability to focus mentally and for you to move your body. So again, cortisol is often demonized and consider this bad thing. And indeed, you don\\'t want cortisol to be chronically or consistently elevated throughout the day or night. But you do want cortisol to reach its peak early in the day right about the time you wake up. One way that you can ensure that that cortisol peak occurs early in the day right about the time that you wake up is to view bright light, ideally from sunlight, within the first 30 to 60 minutes after waking. That\\'s right, view bright sunlight within the first 30 to 60 minutes after waking. I\\'ll get into all the caveats about what happens if you wake up before the sun is out, what if you live in the UK where there is no sun, or people claim there is no sun. Hate to tell you this, folks, but there is sun in the UK. We\\'ll talk about all that. But everybody, whether or not you live in a cloudy place or a sunny place, whether or not there\\'s cloud cover or not that day, should really strive to get bright light in your eyes, ideally from sunlight, within the first 30 to 60 minutes after waking. The reason for that is very simple. You want to trigger that cortisol increase to occur very early in your day, and you don\\'t want that cortisol peak to happen later, which is what will happen if you wait to get outside and see sunlight. The reason for this is that you have a set of neurons, nerve cells, in your eye. They\\'re called intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells, but you do not need to know that name. Those neurons respond best to bright light, and especially right after waking early in the day, they are best able to signal to a set of neurons that reside over the roof of your mouth called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is a cluster of neurons that then sends a huge number of other signals, electrical and chemical, out to your entire body that triggers that cortisol increase, provides a wake-up signal for your brain and body, and sets in motion a timer for you to fall asleep later that night. So again, we\\'re not trying to go into too much mechanism today. We are trying to really hammer on tools and I\\'ll substantiate those tools just a bit with some mechanism. But here\\'s what you do, or at least here\\'s what I do. I wake up in the morning and I want to reach for my phone, but I know that even if I were to crank up the brightness on that phone screen, it\\'s not bright enough to trigger that cortisol spike and for me to be at my most alert and focused throughout the day and to optimize my sleep at night. So what I do is I get out of bed and I go outside. And if it\\'s a bright, clear day and the sun is low in the sky or the sun is, you know, starting to get overhead, what we call low solar angle, then I know I\\'m getting outside at the right time. If there\\'s cloud cover and I can\\'t see the sun, I also know I\\'m doing a good thing because it turns out, especially on cloudy days, you want to get outside and get as much light energy or photons in your eyes. But let\\'s say it\\'s a very clear day and I can see where the sun is. I do not need to stare directly into the sun. If it\\'s very low in the sky, I might do that because it\\'s not going to be very painful to my eyes. However, if the sun is a little bit brighter and a little bit higher in the sky, sometimes it could be painful to look at. So the way to get this sunlight viewing early in the day is to look toward the sun. If it\\'s too bright to look at directly, well, then don\\'t do that. You just look toward it, but not directly at it. It\\'s absolutely fine to blink. In fact, I encourage you to blink whenever you feel the impulse to blink. Never look at any light, sunlight or otherwise, that\\'s so bright that it\\'s painful to look at \\'cause you can damage your eyes. But for this morning sunlight viewing, it\\'s best to not wear sunglasses, that\\'s right, to not wear sunglasses, at least for this morning sunlight viewing. It is absolutely fine to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses, so-called corrective lenses. In fact, those will serve you well in this practice or this tool because they will focus the light onto your neural retina and onto those melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells. If your eyeglasses or contact lenses have UV protection, that\\'s okay. There\\'s so many different wavelengths of light coming from the sun and they are bright enough that they will trigger the mechanisms that you want triggered at this early time of day. So try and get outside, ideally within the first five minutes of waking or maybe it\\'s 15 minutes, but certainly within the first hour after waking. I want to share with you three critical things about this tool of morning sunlight viewing. First of all, this is not some woo biology thing. This is grounded in the core of our physiology. There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of quality peer-reviewed papers showing that light viewing early in the day is the most powerful stimulus for wakefulness throughout the day and it has a powerful, positive impact on your ability to fall and stay asleep at night. So this is really the foundational power tool for ensuring a great night\\'s sleep and for feeling more awake during the day. Second of all, if you wake up before the sun is out, you can, and probably should, flip on artificial lights in your internal home environment or apartment or wherever you happen to live if your goal is to be awake, right? If you wake up at four in the morning and you need to be awake, well, then turn on artificial lights. Once the sun is out, however, once the sun has risen, then you still want to get outside and view sunlight. Some of you will wake up before the sun comes out. And if you\\'re asking whether or not turning on artificial lights can replace sunlight at those hours, unfortunately, the answer is no. Unless you have a very special light, and we\\'ll talk about what kind of light, the bright artificial lights in your home environment are not, I repeat, are not going to be sufficiently bright to turn on the cortisol mechanism and the other wake-up mechanisms that you need early in the day. The diabolical twist, however, is that those lights in your home or apartment or even on your phone are bright enough to disrupt your sleep if you look at them too late at night or in the middle of the night. So there\\'s this asymmetry in our retinal, our eye biology, and in our brain\\'s biology, whereby early in the day, right around waking, you need a lot of light, a lot of photons, a lot of light energy, and artificial lights generally just won\\'t accomplish what you need them to accomplish. But at night, even a little bit of artificial light can really mess up your so- called circadian, your 24-hour clocks, and all these mechanisms that we\\'re talking about. So if you wake up before the sun is out and it\\'s still dark, please turn on as many bright artificial lights as you possibly can or need, but then get outside once the sun is out. On cloudy days, you especially need to get outside. I repeat, on cloudy days, overcast days, you especially need to get outside and get sunlight. You just need to get more of it. Now, how much light and how much light viewing do you need? This is going to vary depending on person and place, literally where you live on earth, whether or not there\\'s a lot of tree cover, whether or not you\\'re somebody who has sensitive eyes or less sensitive eyes. It\\'s really impossible for me to give an absolute prescriptive, but we can give some general guidelines. In general, on a clear day, meaning no cloud cover or minimal cloud cover, you want to get this sunlight exposure to your eyes for about five minutes or so. Could be three minutes one day, could be seven minutes the next day, about five minutes. On a day where there\\'s cloud cover, so the sun is just peeking through the clouds or it\\'s more dense cloud cover, you want to get about 10 minutes of sunlight exposure to your eyes early in the day. And on days that are really densely overcast or maybe even are rainy, you\\'re going to want to get as much as 20 or 30 minutes of sunlight exposure. Another key thing is do not, forget about, just don\\'t try and get this sunlight exposure through a windshield of a car or a window, whether or not it\\'s tinted or otherwise. It takes far too long. It\\'s simply not going to trigger the relevant mechanisms. You would be standing there all day trying to get enough light into your eyes from the morning sunlight and by then the sun will have already moved from low solar angle to overhead and it simply won\\'t work for all sorts of mechanisms related to your circadian rhythm functions. So just don\\'t try and do it through a windshield, sunglasses, or a window. It\\'s just not going to work. Get outside. If the weather is really bad or for whatever reason, safety reasons, you cannot get outside, well, then I suppose try and get near a window. That would be the last, last resort. But you really want to get outside to get this sunlight exposure. Now, if you live in a part of the world where it\\'s extremely dark and overcast or the weather won\\'t let you outside or you live in a cave or some other small box that does not allow any natural light into it for whatever reason, well, then you\\'re going to need a replacement for that sunlight. And there are sunlight simulators or daylight simulators that you can purchase. Those are quite expensive in general and therefore I suggest cheaper options that work just as well because they get just as bright. Things like ring lights that are sold in order for people to take selfies and this kind of thing. A drawing LED tablet will work pretty well. I actually have one of those and I put it on my desk all morning even though I still get outside and look at sunlight first thing in the morning, again, also, especially, I should say, on cloudy days. We do not have any affiliation to any ring lights or LED lights or these panels. So we will provide a link to a couple of different options if you want to explore the various options. I don\\'t know what people\\'s different budgets are. I don\\'t know where people live. I just know that many of our listeners live in locations throughout the world where, for instance, during the winter, it gets very, very dark, so they can\\'t get sufficient sunlight. But get that morning light, ideally from sunlight, and take into account all the specific points that I\\'ve given you here. And, I should say, enjoy this practice. It\\'s really nice to get outside first thing in the morning and get this sunlight. In fact, when you start doing this, you\\'ll notice that your body will start to feel more energized and it will feel more energized more quickly. You\\'ll actually start to notice this mechanism kicking in each day, especially if you\\'re paying attention to your physiology. So enjoy this practice of getting outside. Yes, you can take your morning beverage outside. Yes, you can take your dog with you. In fact, animals intuitively know to get this morning sunlight. They actually seek it out at the right times of days. We human beings need to be told by podcasters and other people about the science that supports these kinds of practices. Our pets apparently do not. But get outside alone or with somebody, with your kids, with your dog. However you go about this practice, make sure you do this practice at least 80% of the days of your life. That\\'s right. If you miss a day, for instance, you\\'re bedridden for a day, try and get next to a window. Let\\'s say you are traveling, or for whatever reason, you are not able to get outside first thing in the morning, well, then try to get twice as much sunlight in your eyes, or I should say extend the duration of sunlight viewing in the morning for twice as long the following day. This is a slow, integrative mechanism that underlies this whole thing of wakefulness during the day and sleep at night due to sunlight viewing and if you miss a day, you can make up for it the next day, but you have to get twice as much light or twice as much duration of light. If you really want to get technical and you really want to measure how much light is in your environment, you can download a free app, something like Light Meter, and that will allow your phone to act as a bit of a light meter. It\\'ll give you a pretty accurate measurement of how many lux, which is a measure of brightness, are in your environment in the morning. And in general, that\\'s just going to be a good tool for evaluating your environments. Here\\'s what I suggest you do. Wake up in the morning, take Light Meter, point it at the brightest light in your home, and take a measurement, and what you\\'ll probably find is it\\'s about a thousand lux. Now go outside and if there\\'s some sunlight out and there\\'s cloud cover, point it at the sky and press that button. You can actually hold it down and it\\'ll give you a dynamically updated lux measurement. And what you\\'ll find is like 5,000, 10,000, sometimes even 90,000 lux, even though you don\\'t experience it as so much brighter, and that\\'s because an indoor artificial light is very concentrated over a small spatial area whereas the sunlight is very diffuse. But it\\'s that diffuse, very bright sunlight, that photon energy, that you really want that\\'s going to set all the rhythms of your brain and body in the proper way. Not just that cortisol peak, but it\\'s going to trigger proper metabolism, it\\'s going to set a timer for you to be able to fall asleep about 16 hours later, and on and on and on. And I should mention within the on and on and on, it\\'s also going to suppress any melatonin, a hormone that makes you sleepy that happens to be swimming around in your bloodstream at the time you wake up. It does a number of other things too, including interact with the adenosine system and kind of wash out some of the adenosine that might still be residual if you didn\\'t sleep enough. Fundamentally speaking, get that morning sunlight viewing. I promise you will be grateful that you did. It makes everybody feel better, feel more alert, and it will greatly assist with your ability to fall and stay asleep later that night. Before we continue with today\\'s discussion, we\\'re going to take a brief pause to acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens, also called AG1. I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012. So I\\'m delighted that they\\'ve been a sponsor of this podcast. Athletic Greens contains vitamins, minerals, probiotics, digestive enzymes, and adaptogens. So it\\'s got a lot of things in there. That\\'s actually the reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it once or twice a day. It essentially covers all of my nutritional bases. And the probiotics in particular are important to me because of the critical importance of what\\'s called the gut-brain axis, that is neurons and other cell types in the gut, in the digestive tract, that communicate with the brain and the brain back to the digestive tract in order to control things like mood, immune function, hormone function, and on and on. Whenever somebody has asked me what\\'s the one supplement they should take, I always answer Athletic Greens. I gave that answer long before I ever had this podcast and it\\'s the answer I still give now for all the reasons that I detailed just a moment ago. If you\\'d like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They\\'ll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you\\'re on the road, plus a year\\'s supply of vitamin D3K2, which are also very important for a huge number of bodily factors and brain factors 00:30:46 Morning Tools: Temperature & Deliberate Cold Exposure, Exercise that impact your immediate and long-term health. Again, that\\'s athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim that special offer. Okay, so now we\\'re still focusing on this early part of the day when you\\'ve woken up, the first hour or so after waking. And we can go to our list of other levers and tools, right? We have light and dark. We already talked about light and sunlight in particular. We\\'ve got temperature, food, exercise, caffeine, supplements, and digital tools. Now, once you\\'ve woken up and you want to be awake, okay? So this is likely to be early in the day if you\\'re following a more standard schedule. You will also want to leverage not just light, but temperature as a tool. If you are inclined, it would be wise to try and increase your core body temperature a bit more quickly than it would otherwise if you were to just, you know, shuffle around outside, get your sunlight, maybe read a little bit, et cetera, and there are two main ways you can do that. The first way is to get into cold water of some sort. So this could be a cold shower of anywhere from one to three minutes. This could be an ice bath if that\\'s your thing. It could be a cold tub, or if you own a cold tub that\\'s specifically designed for deliberate cold exposure. Get under some cold water. That will certainly wake you up. And if you\\'ve ever jumped into cold water or had a cold shower, you know it really wakes you up because you release adrenaline, epinephrine, from both your brain and body, the body from your adrenals and your brain from a little cluster of neurons called locus coeruleus. Again, the names don\\'t matter. One to three minutes of cold water exposure will wake you up because of that adrenaline release and, and I want to highlight the and, it will serve to increase your core body temperature. That\\'s right, your body and brain interact as a bit of a thermostat system where if you put something cold on the surface of your body, your brain, a little cluster of neurons in the so-called medial preoptic area, act as a thermostat and say, \"Ah, the external of my body is cold and therefore I\\'m going to heat up my core body temperature.\" So it\\'s a little bit paradoxical. People think, oh, if you get into cold water or an ice bath, your body temperature is going to drop. And indeed, that\\'s true if you stay in for a while, but if you just get in for about one to three minutes, or under the cold shower for one to three minutes, your core body temperature will increase. So then when you get out of that cold water, your body temperature is increasing at a rate, at a slope, that\\'s steeper than it would otherwise and you\\'re going to feel more alert. It also has the advantage of increasing not just adrenaline, but dopamine, which is a molecule involved in motivation, focus, et cetera. So this is great for waking up. So we\\'ve got sunlight, we\\'ve got temperature triggered by cold water, and we have exercise. One of the best ways to increase your core body temperature early in the day is to do exercise. Now, some of you might choose to do your full-blown workout for the day first thing when you wake up in the morning, I would say the best time to exercise, at least what the research points to, is immediately when you wake up in the morning or three hours after waking or 11 hours after waking. But that\\'s really getting down into optimization for sake of muscular strength and grip strength and it\\'s very hard to give a strict prescriptive. Here\\'s what I suggest. If you want to be alert early in the day and you want to sleep great at night, get that bright sunlight, get into some cold water, and if you don\\'t want to get into some cold water, try and get some movement. It could be a walk. So you can get your sunlight exposure while you\\'re taking a walk first thing in the morning. It could be a light jog. It could be skipping rope. These days, I skip rope for about 10 minutes or 20 minutes while looking at the sun. So I\\'m trying to layer in these different things for waking up. And then I take a cold shower afterwards. This is what I\\'ve been doing as of lately, but I don\\'t do that all year long necessarily. Or some of you are going to be working out mid-morning. I sometimes do that. But try and get your core body temperature increased first thing in the morning, and a great way to do that is with the cold water and/or with exercise. And again, it doesn\\'t have to be your full-blown workout for the day if you\\'re doing workouts consistently, which I hope everybody is because everybody really should exercise at least, I believe, five or six, or maybe even seven days a week. For me, it\\'s six days a week, sometimes five, rarely is it seven. So get that exercise or even just a modest amount of movement, walking, jogging, skipping rope, some light calisthenics. That will further increase your core body temperature and help you feel more awake. Then we have the category of caffeine. And again, we\\'re just talking about this early part of the day, and you might be saying, \"Wait a second, I thought this was an episode about tools for sleep.\" Well, everything that we\\'re talking about doing in these first 60 to 90 minutes of the day really set in motion a wave of biological cascades that carry through the entire day and into the evening and into the night and really do serve to optimize sleep. So just hang in there with me. And for those of you that are interested in focus and attention, your ability to learn, all of these tools and practices are going to greatly enhance those as well. So the next category of tool for use early in the day is caffeine. Caffeine is a very important compound to think about. I do realize that some people who are prone to anxiety, especially panic attacks, anxiety attacks, might avoid caffeine entirely. That\\'s absolutely fine. You do not have to drink caffeine. So what I\\'m about to describe are ways to leverage caffeine use to optimize sleep and wakefulness if you are comfortable with caffeine, if you like caffeine, I happen to love caffeine. I like it in the form of coffee or espresso or yerba mate tea, in particular non-smoked varieties of yerba mate tea. Non-smoked because the smoked varieties seem to carry some carcinogenics, some cancer causing risk. There\\'s increasing data on that. So non-smoked varieties of yerba mate. So caffeine is something that a lot of people consume early in the day. How much depends on your tolerance, and there\\'s a lot of individual variability here. Again, caffeine is an adenosine antagonist, or effectively works as an adenosine antagonist and limits sleepiness. I highly recommend that everybody delay their caffeine intake for 90 to 120 minutes after waking. However painful it may be to eventually arrive at that 90 to 120 minutes after waking, you want, and I encourage you, to clear out whatever residual adenosine is circulating in your system in that first 90 to 120 minutes of the day. Get that sunlight exposure, get some movement to wake up, and then, and only then, start to ingest caffeine because what you\\'ll do if you delay caffeine intake until 90 to 120 minutes after waking is you will avoid the so-called afternoon crash. And you may still get a little bit of dip in energy in the afternoon, but it\\'s not going to be that massive crash. I\\'ve talked about the reasons for that crash on previous episodes. But if you delay your caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes after waking, you are doing yourself a great service towards wakefulness and to avoid the crash. And the afternoon crash has another liability to it, which is typically people will emerge from that afternoon crash either grumpy or groggy and then they\\'ll lean into drinking more caffeine, which can then disrupt their sleep. So wait 90 to 120 minutes after waking in the morning to drink caffeine. And if you drink caffeine at any point throughout the day, really try and avoid any caffeine, certainly avoid drinking more than a hundred milligrams of caffeine after 4:00 p.m. and probably even better to limit your last caffeine intake to 3:00 p.m. or even 2:00 p.m. And for many people, shifting that caffeine intake from immediately after waking in the morning to 90 to 120 minutes gives them a much longer arc of energy throughout the day and they don\\'t feel the need to drink more caffeine later in the afternoon. If you do drink caffeine later in the afternoon, really try and limit the total amount or drink decaf. Certainly keep the total amount to less than a hundred milligrams if you are interested in getting into the best possible sleep. And I say this knowing that many people, including myself, can drink a double espresso with 200 milligrams of caffeine or more at 5:00 p.m. or even 6:00 p.m. or after dinner and still, quote, unquote, fall asleep fine or still sleep fine. However, there are terrific data, Matt Walker and I talked about this, and there are more and more papers all the time that point to the fact that caffeine intake late in the day, after 4:00 p.m. that is, can really disrupt the architecture of your sleep. So you might think you\\'re sleeping well, but you\\'re not sleeping nearly as well as you could if you avoided caffeine in those afternoon hours. Now, some of you might be doing your main about of exercise first thing in the morning and you want your caffeine before that about of exercise. In that case, I say, go for it. Drink your caffeine, do your workout right after waking up. I don\\'t have a problem with that. You will find, however, that you\\'re going to get an early afternoon dip in energy and that dip in energy is going to be substantial because it\\'s going to be a dip in energy that naturally follows that workout from the morning. So it\\'s dependent on temperature, and it\\'s going to be related to the elimination of that adenosine blockade by caffeine. So you\\'re getting a kind of a one-two punch on your energy levels by taking a lot of caffeine and exercising early in the day. You can sort of expect that you\\'re going to get a drop in energy in the early afternoon. That\\'s okay if that works for you, but just know that delaying that caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking would be the ideal scenario most days and most scenarios. All that said, I absolutely respect the fact that people have different work schedules, kid schedules, et cetera. So if you want to do some or none or all these tools, that\\'s really up to you. I\\'m just providing them to you in the simplest form that I can possibly provide them. Now, the other lever or tool that you have available to you is food. Not just what you eat, but when you eat. And it turns out that if you eat early in the day, you support a biological clock mechanism that will make you more alert early in the day. That said, many people choose to fast in the early morning hours of the day or in the first part of the day. I\\'m one such person. I generally don\\'t ingest any food until about 11:00 a.m. or 12 noon. Sometimes I\\'ll have a protein shake. Sometimes I\\'ll have some almonds. Sometimes I\\'ll have breakfast. If people are meeting for brunch or breakfast, I will have breakfast for social reasons every once in a while. But most of the time I don\\'t eat until about lunch time. However, some people are really hungry when they wake up in the morning. Just know that if you eat early in the day, you are further triggering an increase in metabolism and in temperature that will make you more alert. So you don\\'t have to eat early in the day, but you can start to see how these different tools layer together. Sunlight viewing, exercise, cold water, eating. Many of them are converging on the same mechanisms. In fact, when you drink caffeine, there\\'s also a small increase in body temperature due to the adrenaline increase that it stimulates. So all of these things can be layered on top of one another or you can use them individually or think about them individually. Now, food is an interesting lever or tool because it\\'s not just about when you eat, but it\\'s also about what you eat. And I\\'ve talked a lot about eating for energy and what that means in terms of caloric energy versus neural energy, et cetera, in previous podcast episodes. We\\'re not going to focus on that now because, frankly, to get into a description of whether or not somebody should eat fruits or vegetables or animal proteins or dairy, et cetera, early in the day, that\\'s very nuanced. What you eat for your breakfast, or if you choose to not eat breakfast, is really up to you. All that said, if you eat a very large meal, it doesn\\'t matter if you slept terrifically well 10 hours the night before or if you are about to go to sleep or if it\\'s the middle of the afternoon, if your gut is full of food, there\\'s just a large volume of food in your gut, it\\'s going to divert a lot of blood and other critical resources away from other organs of your body, in particular, your brain, and you\\'re going to be sleepy after eating a big meal. So this is sort of a duh, but I think oftentimes in the discussions about what to eat for energy, people neglect to consider food volume as a strong parameter or variable in that discussion. So if you eat a huge breakfast, it\\'s likely that you are going to be tired immediately after eating that breakfast unless of course you exercise very hard prior to that and you metabolize all that food very quickly. So it\\'s up to you whether or not to eat first thing in the morning or not. But if you do eat in the first few hours of the morning, just understand that you are setting or you are helping to set a food entrained, as it\\'s called, circadian clock. Light, temperature, timing of food intake, movement and exercise, all of these things literally funnel in in a neural sense, they funnel into this thing that we call the circadian clock and they let that clock, that set of neurons, predict when you are likely to be eating and active and viewing sunlight the next day and the next day and the next day. I say all this because there are some beautiful studies, and I\\'ll highlight one, again, in the show note captions, that show that if people are having a hard time waking up in the morning, one of the things they can do is maximize sunlight viewing, exercise in the morning, drink caffeine. Although, again, I support the idea that that would best be done about 90 to 120 minutes after waking. Eating some food in those early morning hours, et cetera, et cetera. You can layer in multiple levers or tools in order to be more alert. And that\\'s what these levers and tools are really there for in this sense of what we\\'re talking about today, which is optimizing sleep. Yes, they will make you more alert. Yes, they will provide some adrenaline and dopamine, for instance, the cold water, et cetera, et cetera. But the reason we\\'re talking about these things in the context of sleep is that they start to give your body some predictable autonomic timing. What is predictable autonomic timing? Well, your autonomic nervous system is the components of your brain and body that cause wakefulness and sleepiness and you can start to create some predictability in that autonomic timing. You can start to do things that really make it such that you naturally wake up at six in the morning or five in the morning. That\\'s right, if you\\'re somebody who naturally is a night owl, who likes to stay up until two in the morning and sleep until 10:00 a.m., and you now have a job or you have to go to school or you have a partner that likes to get up early and go to sleep early, well, you can make that happen and you can make that happen pretty painlessly if you take a week or so and go to sleep 30 minutes or an hour earlier each night, set an alarm and wake up 30 minutes or an hour earlier each morning until, of course, you\\'re waking up at the time you want to wake up, and then even in that groggy state, get some exercise, get some sunlight viewing. If the sun\\'s not out, turn on those bright artificial lights. Have some breakfast, even if you\\'re not hungry. In fact, for those of you that engage in shift work because you have to, or travel and you\\'re jet lagged, one of the quickest ways to shift your circadian clock and get onto the local schedule is to eat on the local schedule. So what all these tools do is they really set up a cascade. Think of it as kind of a wavefront of wakefulness and focus throughout the day. It\\'ll take you through the middle of the day and the afternoon stage we\\'ll talk about in a few minutes, but really they take you to this period that is about 5:00 p.m. until your bedtime. I realize some people are going to bed very early, like 8:00 p.m. or 9:00 p.m., which to me seems very early, but very few people go to sleep at 5:00 p.m. right? Unless you\\'re doing that for shift work or other reasons. But from 5:00 p.m. until bedtime is really a critical period in which you need to leverage particular tools in order to get and stay asleep optimally and to be able to sleep through the night. So really there are three critical periods throughout each 24-hour cycle. And during each of those critical periods, you\\'re going to want to do as many specific things as you can to optimize your wakefulness and focus and mood throughout the day and your sleep at night. The first critical period is the one that we\\'ve been talking about up until now. Things like morning sunlight viewing, caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking, exercise, and so on. We can call that critical period one and it really encompasses the time from which you wake up until about three hours after waking. Although, I should just mention \\'cause there are always those people that say, \"Wait, I wake up at 4:00 a.m. and the sun isn\\'t out until 8:00 a.m.,\" okay, so it might be four hours. But really it\\'s those early morning hours of your day once you\\'re awake. The second critical period is the time throughout the day and afternoon leading into evening. So you may ask what are the things that you can do throughout the day, the middle of your day and into the afternoon and evening hours, that are really going to set you up for the best possible sleep later that night. Well, there are a few dos and there are a few don\\'ts. First of all, be careful about ingesting too much caffeine throughout the middle of the day. That\\'s kind of an obvious one for the reasons that we talked about earlier. Second of all, if you are a napper, and I raise my hand now, for those of you listening, I\\'m raising my right hand because I love naps. I\\'ve always loved naps. Nowadays I do NSDR or a Reveri sleep hypnosis almost every day. And I tend to do that, as I mentioned, in the early afternoon hours if I\\'m feeling kind of sleepy, because even though I optimize my caffeine intake timing, et cetera, I tend to get a little sleepy in the afternoon. Most people get a little sleepy in the afternoon. Some of that is related to hitting that peak of body temperature. And you might think, wait, I thought high body temperature is associated with alertness, and it is, but right as you crest that high body temperature and your body temperature starts to drop, there\\'s a tendency to be a little bit sleepy. So some of you might opt to take a nap in the afternoon. Should you nap, should you not nap? That\\'s a question that I get asked a lot and that I asked Dr. Matthew Walker when he was a guest on this podcast. Here was his answer and here\\'s what the data support. It is fine to nap in the afternoon, but don\\'t nap so late in the day or for so long that it disrupts your ability to fall and stay asleep at night for your major sleep about, okay? So naps are fine, but don\\'t sleep so long during the day or too late in the day that it disrupts your ability to fall and stay asleep. I should also say you do not have to nap. It\\'s kind of an interesting phenomenon that happens on these podcasts and on social media where we\\'ll talk about naps and the fact that naps are great, but don\\'t make them longer than 90 minutes, but then all the non-nappers get really worried. Like, wait, am I supposed to nap? I don\\'t like naps. I wake up groggy. You do not have to nap. In fact, if you can make it through your whole day without napping, great, more power to you. But if you do nap and you find that naps serve you well, keep those naps shorter than 90 minutes for reasons related to ultradian cycles and so forth, and make sure that you don\\'t nap too late in the day that you are then staying up too late at night and having a hard time waking up the next morning. I will say that for a lot of people who do not like naps or that find they wake up really grumpy from naps or groggy from naps, I encourage you to try the Reveri app, try an NSDR script, try yoga nidra. Try something of that sort for anywhere from 10 to 20 to 30 minutes. I tend to do this every day now. I\\'ll just lie down, and I love yoga nidra, I love NSDR scripts, I love using the Reveri app. In particular, the portion of the Reveri app that gets you better at sleeping. It really is beneficial for me because it serves as very replenishing while I\\'m doing that hypnosis, but it\\'s also gotten me much better at falling and staying asleep and falling back asleep in the middle of the night. So this critical period throughout the day is one in which most people are doing a lot of stuff. They\\'re emailing and picking up kids and they\\'re exercising and they\\'re commuting and doing all sorts of things, taking phone calls and Zooms, et cetera. But if you can get that period of deep relaxation through a nap or NSDR, that\\'s going to serve you well. Try not to drink too much caffeine, certainly no more than a hundred milligrams of caffeine, after 4:00 p.m if your goal is to fall asleep at a reasonably normal time. And for those of you that exercise in the afternoon, understand that if you exercise very intensely, so this might be weight training or running or some other very intense exercise, typically that\\'s going to further increase your body temperature. Makes sense, right? Based on everything we know about metabolism and body temperature. And it\\'s going to so-called delay your circadian clock. It\\'s going to make it such that you want to fall asleep a little bit later, maybe even a lot later. So if you\\'re exercising in the afternoon or evening and that\\'s the only time you can exercise or that\\'s the time that you prefer to exercise, great, but be careful about ingesting too much caffeine in order to get the energy to do that exercise \\'cause that caffeine will disrupt your sleep and just know that you are delaying your circadian clock. You are making it such that you will naturally want to go to sleep later and wake up later. Contrast that with if you exercise early in the day, say, immediately after waking up or in the first zero to four hours after waking, in most cases, that\\'s not going to shift your circadian clock much. And toward the end of the episode, we\\'ll talk a little bit about forced exercise prior to wake-up times. That doesn\\'t mean doing exercise in your sleep. That means deliberately setting an alarm and getting out of bed much earlier than you naturally would. That turns out to be a very potent tool to so-called advance your circadian clock. So we can talk about that a little bit later in the episode. But this critical period, too, in the middle of the day is when you\\'re going to want to leverage specific tools, and we\\'ve talked about those: limiting caffeine intake; being mindful of the clock-delaying effects of exercise; the fact that, also, if you\\'re going to nap, you don\\'t want to nap too long or too late into the day otherwise you\\'ll disrupt your nighttime sleep. So this critical period two, or second critical period, I should say, during the middle of the day is a time in which you should be doing certain things and avoiding doing certain things. So that raises the question of whether or not you should also be getting a lot of light, in particular, sunlight, throughout the day. Now, that\\'s something that hasn\\'t been explored too much in the literature until recently when Dr. Samer Hattar who\\'s the director of the chronobiology unit at the National Institutes of Mental Health, decided to do a number of experiments exploring the effects of light on mood and other aspects of brain function and body function when that light is delivered not just in the morning, which is great for us, but also throughout the day. So should you be looking at sunlight or bright artificial lights throughout the day? Now, on the face of it, you might just think, yes, you know, sunlight\\'s great. Provided we\\'re not getting a sunburn and we\\'re not staring at the sun and damaging our eyes, we should get as much sunlight as we possibly can. In fact, we talked about this in the episode on hormones about how getting light onto as much of our skin as we can throughout the day can really help in the production of testosterone and estrogen in both men and women in healthy ways that improves mood and libido and all sorts of things that are associated with wellbeing. However, because light is such a powerful stimulus for controlling the timing of your sleepfulness, or sleepiness, I should say, and wakefulness, we might want to be cautious about how much light we are viewing in the afternoon, in particular, in the early evening hours, right? Well, turns out it\\'s not so straightforward. Viewing, so sunlight to the eyes, sunlight in the late afternoon and evening hours, so again, depends on time of year, depends on location that you happen to be in, but getting some sunlight in your eyes for, again, maybe five or 10, maybe 30 minutes, depending on how much cloud cover there is, doing that in the afternoon serves an additional beneficial purpose, which is you protect or you inoculate your nervous system against some of the negative effects of bright artificial light or even dim artificial light in the nighttime hours between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., which is really critical period three. And we\\'ll talk about what to do and what to not do during critical period three of every 24-hour cycle. But to make it very clear what I\\'m saying here, get that morning sunlight in your eyes, but also get some sunlight in your eyes in the late afternoon and evening hours when the sun is at so-called low solar angle, when it starts to descend in the sky. Again, you don\\'t have to stare directly at the sun, although if you can catch a nice, beautiful sunset, go for it. But as the sun starts to descend, it triggers those same neurons in your eye that communicate with your circadian clock, but it communicates with a different component or different compartment within the circadian clock. That circadian clock is not just one thing. It\\'s multiple things. And you have what are called morning oscillators and evening oscillators. And to make a long story short, the tool that I\\'m describing of looking at the sun in the late afternoon and evening, again, blinking is fine, don\\'t stare at the sun, but getting that sunlight in your eyes in the late afternoon and evening signals to that clock that it\\'s evening time and that sleep is coming. It also serves as a second anchor or reference point for your body and your brain to know where it is in time. Remember back to the beginning of the episode when I said your brain and your body and all your organs are locked inside this skin and this skull and they don\\'t know what\\'s going on in the outside world. Well, that morning sunlight viewing and the other things you do during critical period one, those provide one strong set of signals that it\\'s wake-up time and time to be alert and time to be focused. And then in the evening, by getting sunlight in your eyes again, in particular, sunlight that comes from low solar angle sunlight, well, that provides a second stimulus or a second reference point that tells your brain and body, \"Hey, it\\'s evening. The sun is descending.\" Now, you might say, \"Wait, how does the brain and these neurons know the difference between morning light and evening light?\" It turns out has to do with the particular wavelengths of light that are present in morning versus evening. It\\'s an incredible mechanism. And you are probably familiar with the fact that when the sun is directly overhead, it\\'s really bright white and yellow and the sky\\'s often blue, and if there\\'s cloud cover, it just comes through as a bunch of bright light, well, next time you\\'re out in the morning, take a look at what a sunrise looks like. There\\'s a lot of yellow-blue contrast, and those yellow blues signal important specific sets of cells in your eye and brain that it\\'s morning. In the evening, you\\'re also going to see yellow and blue, but the ratio of yellows and blues has now changed and you also see some oranges, and in a really brilliant sunset, you\\'ll see some reds. If you haven\\'t noticed this already, you\\'ll really want to look for this. It\\'s really kind of fun and cool to look at. Well, those yellows and blues and oranges that you see in the evening sunsets, those signal to your brain and body that evening is there and that nighttime is coming and they\\'re really establishing a second reference point or wavefront of biological signals that are going to optimize your nighttime hours and your transition into really terrific sleep. So now let\\'s talk about what I\\'m calling critical period three of each 24-hour cycle. So this would be the period of time of late evening, So it might be 6:00 p.m. for some, depending on when you go to sleep, or 7:00 p.m. extending into the hours in which you decide to get into bed and go to sleep and then throughout the night. There are a number of things that you\\'re going to want to do and there are a number of things that you are going to want to avoid doing in order to optimize your sleep. First of all, you\\'re going to want to avoid bright artificial lights of any color. Yes, of any color. We haven\\'t talked a lot about blue blockers, you know, lenses that block blue wavelengths or short wavelengths of light. I don\\'t have anything against blue blockers. In fact, many people find that blue blockers provide them some relief from headache and some eye strain if they wear blue blockers throughout the day and certainly at night. But you don\\'t need them, and even if you do wear them, you will find that if lights are very bright, doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s a blue light, a yellow light, or a red light, those bright lights will wake up your brain and body. They will activate the same mechanisms that were activated early in the day by sunlight. However, and here\\'s the really diabolical twist, I mentioned this earlier, but the diabolical twist in the way that your brain and body respond to light is that early in the day, in the morning hours, you need a lot of bright light, ideally from sunlight, to be very alert and to wake up, but in the evening hours and nighttime hours, it takes very little light, very few photons, in order to wake up your brain and body and to disrupt your circadian clock and disrupt your sleep. So what that means is that once the sun goes down, which, of course, is going to happen at different times of year in different places on earth, but once the sun goes down, you would be wise to try and dim the lights in your indoor environment most days, right? I realize some nights you\\'re going to throw a party and have people over. You might not want to dim the lights. Some nights you\\'re going to go out, you might view a lot of bright lights. But most nights of your life, you\\'re going to want to dim the lights in your internal environment. And ideally, the lights that you do use you would place low in that physical environment. So you would try and not use overhead lights, but rather rely on desk lamps or lights even placed low to the floor, even on the floor. If you are going to use light at night, and most people do, I would encourage you to use as little artificial light as is required to carry out the activities you need to require safely. That could be studying, in which case you might need a little bit more light in order to read or study. If you\\'re watching a television show or you\\'re watching something on your computer, dim that screen way, way down, as dim as possible while still, of course, being able to view what you need to view. Even better, I should say, ideally, you would use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, some nights the moon is really bright and you actually can use moonlight to go about your usual activities. Moonlight might seem very, very bright, but, actually, moonlight is fairly low light intensity, and candlelight, which can also seem very bright, actually is very low light intensity. If you\\'re sitting across a table with some candlelight there and it\\'s a really bright candle, chances are it\\'s only about three to 10 lux, which is very, very little light energy compared to, say, an artificial desk lamp or an overhead light, which is going to be in the area of anywhere from a hundred to a thousand lux. So candlelight is fine. Of course, be cautious with open flame, but candlelight is fine. Moonlight is fine. Dimming artificial lights is fine provided they\\'re dimmed way, way down. And again, try and avoid using overhead artificial lights. The absolute worst lights are going to be overhead fluorescent lights of the sort that you would have in the supermarket or that you would see at a gas station or something of that sort. And I confess, there are times in which I\\'m driving home and it\\'s late at night and I want to be able to get to sleep and I\\'ll need to stop at the grocery store or a gas station or something like that, I\\'ve actually put on sunglasses at night in order to avoid getting that bright light exposure at night. Although that\\'s a little bit extreme, I have done that from time to time because that bright light exposure will absolutely quash, it will eliminate, any melatonin that happens to be circulating in your brain and body. Now, melatonin, a lot of people think of it as a supplement, but melatonin is naturally released as the evening comes about and into the nighttime hours. It\\'s the hormone that makes you feel sleepy and allows you to fall asleep. So viewing bright light in the late evening hours and nighttime hours is really not good for your sleep quality and your ability to fall and stay asleep. So for most people, a simple rule of thumb is going to be avoid bright artificial lights of all colors, and in particular, overhead bright artificial lights, between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. That\\'s right, between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., avoid those bright artificial lights as much as possible. Use only as much light as is absolutely necessary in order to carry out the routines and activities you need to carry out safely. I should mention that the reason overhead lights are problematic is the same reason why sunlight is so great early in the day, which is that the cells, that is, the neurons, that can wake up your brain and body through activation of the circadian clock reside mainly in the bottom half or 2/3 of your neural retina and the way the optics of your eyes work is that the cells on the bottom half of your eye view the upper visual field. So this is a beautiful adaptive mechanism that allows these cells to respond to overhead light from sunlight in the early part of the day and throughout the day. But in the evening, if you have bright artificial lights on and those bright artificial lights are overhead lights, it\\'s going to more closely mimic what sunlight does in the evening time, and that turns out to be a bad thing if your goal is to eventually go to sleep. So again, do like the Scandinavians do. Use lights that are set low in the room at night, and if you really want to optimize your sleep-wake cycles, I suppose you could also do the opposite throughout the day. You could really emphasize the use of bright artificial lights and sunlight that comes from above. And of course, sunlight always comes from above. But if you\\'re working in a given office environment and, you know, it\\'s 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. and you want to be as awake as possible, really crank up the overhead lights. And then in the evening, which is this critical period three that we\\'re referring to, really try and dim those lights or have them off or just rely on candlelight or moonlight from the hours of about 10:00 p.m. until 4:00 a.m. Our good friend Samer Hattar, who\\'s been on this podcast before, Samer is director of the chronobiology unit at the National Institutes of Mental Health, well, he\\'s absolutely obsessive about this light stuff and avoiding light at night. In fact, he lives in what I sort of joke is like a cave at night. From 9:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m., which is really his kind of sleep cycle, he has his house so dark that you\\'d be lucky to be able to find a spoon in the kitchen. In fact, you\\'d be lucky to find your way down the hallway if you\\'re me. But in any case, dim the lights. Turn them way, way down. It will serve you well. It will make it much easier for you to get sleepy and stay sleepy and fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night. Now, not to depart from this critical period three, but if you recall, viewing that afternoon light, the low solar angle light as the sun is heading down in the sky, so it could be sunset or what I call circa sunset, around sunset, well, doing that is going to slightly, but not completely, offset any of the negative effects of viewing artificial light at night. So I don\\'t want to give people a pass here, but let\\'s say you know that you\\'re going to watch some Netflix at night or you\\'re going to be up late studying and yet you still want to be able to fall and stay asleep. Definitely make sure you see that evening light. There\\'s a great study. We\\'ll provide a link to this study, which showed that if people view evening sunset light or evening sunsets or sunlight right around the time of sunset, it really serves to inoculate or offset some, again, some, not all, of the negative effects of artificial light between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. Now, that\\'s light. But as you recall, we also have this tool related to temperature, and you\\'re probably not going to be surprised that the way to leverage temperature in the evening is the exact opposite of the way that you want to leverage temperature early in the day. Early in the day, temperature increases from cold showers or exercise, et cetera, wake you up. What that means is that taking a cold shower late at night is probably a bad idea. Rather, taking a nice hot bath or a sauna, you might think would heat up your body, and indeed, that\\'s what happens if you stay in a very long time, but if you do hot tub or a hot bath or a sauna in the evening, and you don\\'t stay in for more than 20 or 30 minutes and you get out, you take maybe a cool-ish shower or a warm shower, then what happens is there\\'s a compensatory cooling off of your core body temperature for the reasons we discussed earlier, and your body temperature will drop by one to three degrees and it will make it much easier to get into sleep. So if you\\'re somebody that enjoys hot baths, hot showers, or hot tubs, evening and nighttime is going to be the best time to do that if your goal is to facilitate sleep. Similarly, you should try and make your sleeping environment pretty cool, if not cold. Now, that doesn\\'t mean you need to be cold while you\\'re asleep. You can get under as many blankets as you need, but it\\'s a good idea to make your sleeping environment cool. In fact, drop the temperature in that sleeping environment by at least three degrees and you\\'ll be happy that you did. Now, some people rely on things like Eight Sleep. I use that. One of these controllable temperature mattress covers. Other people would simply do this by putting a fan in the room or opening a window. Again, depends on time of year, depends on technology, depends on budgets, et cetera. But you\\'re going to want to sleep in a relatively cool or cold sleeping environment and then layer on the blankets as needed to stay asleep. And I say as needed because one of the things that you\\'re going to do in your sleep, or if you happen to wake up, is if you\\'re too warm, you\\'re going to put a foot or a hand out from under those blankets. And the reason for doing that is very logical once you understand the mechanism. You have special portals, you essentially have ways of passing heat, excuse me, in and out of your body primarily through the palms of your hands, the upper half of your face, and the bottoms of your feet through so-called glabrous skin. This was covered in the episode with Dr. Craig Heller from the biology department at Stanford. If you lower the temperature in your sleeping environment, so lower the temperature in that room or use a controllable mattress cover that can cool down like Eight Sleep or something of that sort, it\\'s naturally going to make your sleep environment cooler, and if you\\'re too warm under the blankets, all you have to do is extend a hand or a foot out from under those blankets. Whereas if the sleeping environment that you\\'re in is too warm, there\\'s very little you can do to cool off besides push off those blankets. So for instance, if you\\'re too warm and you\\'re waking up in the middle of the night, which is what happens if you get too warm, you\\'ll push off those blankets. But if the room is too warm, well, what are you going to do? You\\'d probably have to put your hands into some cool water or take a coolish shower or something for a couple of seconds. That\\'s not very practical. Better to just keep the sleeping environment cool. I\\'m not a big fan of people putting socks on while they sleep, or I should say, I\\'m not a fan of putting socks on while I sleep, because that eliminates this glabrous skin portal on the bottoms of one\\'s feet. So for those of you that have heard, you know, wear socks while you sleep, that works great for people that tend to run too cold while they sleep and wake up because their feet get cold, but if you\\'re somebody who wakes up in the middle of the night, chances are you\\'re waking up because you\\'re getting too warm and the best thing that you could do is to cool or lower the temperature in the room that you\\'re sleeping and not wear socks, get under as many blankets as you need to fall asleep, and then across the night, you\\'ll naturally just move a hand or a foot or all hands and feet out from under those blankets to cool off because of the relationship between temperature and sleep. That is, dropping your core body temperature one to three degrees gets you into sleep and helps you stay asleep. So let\\'s say you do exercise late in the day and you\\'re finding yourself very alert in the evening and you need to fall asleep, or let\\'s say you\\'ve exercised and you needed four cups of espresso in order to do that exercise. Well, there are a few things that you can do to try and bring your nervous system down into more state of calmness, and you can do that also by lowering your core body temperature. One of those I already talked about before, taking a nice hot shower or a hot bath and then getting out and cooling off will decrease your body temperature. Maybe not enough to get you into sleep if you have a ton of caffeine in your system. But again, you can use this mechanism of temperature shifts to wake up or temperature shifts to fall asleep in ways that really can help you overcome some of the irregularities in your sleep-wake cycle and exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, of course, nobody\\'s perfect. Some days we end up having to workout in the afternoon or we\\'ll miss the workout entirely. Other days, we end up having that cup of coffee in the afternoon with a friend and then we have a hard time falling asleep. So you can use these tools not just in their optimized form, you know, being absolutely obsessive and compulsive about exactly when you do each of those tools. That would be wonderful, but life happens as they say and some days you\\'re going to feel too alert at night and you want to fall asleep, or you\\'ve got to get up especially early the next morning and you\\'re not somebody who normally goes to bed at 10:00 p.m. Well, that\\'s when a something like a hot bath or a sauna can really benefit you because it can adjust your temperature rhythm accordingly. I would be remiss if I didn\\'t touch on alcohol and CBD and THC. I always get questions about these. And I should say, of course, many places, but not all, THC is illegal. Although, there are medical uses and in some places, it\\'s decriminalized, other places it\\'s legal. Alcohol, of course, is consumed almost as frequently as caffeine is consumed. I personally don\\'t drink alcohol. I don\\'t have anything against it per se. I just don\\'t tend to enjoy it. One of the reasons I don\\'t enjoy it is if I drink alcohol, I simply fall asleep. So that doesn\\'t really accomplish any of the things that I really want to accomplish because the sleep that one gets after drinking alcohol is greatly disrupted sleep. Hate to break it to you, but that\\'s the truth. And when Dr. Matt Walker came on this podcast, he said exactly the same thing. While THC and alcohol do help some people fall asleep and maybe even stay asleep, the architecture of that sleep is suboptimal compared to the sleep they would get without alcohol or THC in their system. So I\\'m not here to tell you what to do or not to do. I\\'m certainly not the substance police. That\\'s not my role. I\\'m just reporting to you the biology. If your sleep is not restoring you to the extent that you feel it should, or if you are regularly relying on a drink or two in order to fall asleep, or THC in order to fall asleep, that is disrupting your total pattern of sleep. However, I do realize that nowadays a lot of people are relying on THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms, in order to fall and stay asleep. And, you know, we can just acknowledge the data. It does seem that there\\'s an anxiety lowering effect of some of those compounds that do help people who have a hard time falling and staying asleep because of reasons related to anxiety. Although, in a moment, we\\'ll talk about some supplements and supplement protocols that can also assist in the ability to fall and stay asleep and that can adjust anxiety and that do not seem to disrupt sleep architecture in negative ways 01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine and, in fact, can enhance the depth and quality of sleep architecture. Okay, so you\\'ve done everything correctly up until now. You got your morning routine from critical period one. You\\'ve got your afternoon routine. You saw some sunlight in the afternoon. You avoided caffeine in the eight hours or 10 hours before bedtime. You\\'re not drinking alcohol. You\\'ve cooled down the room. You\\'re doing all these things right. You\\'ve dimmed the lights, et cetera, et cetera. What else can we do in order to optimize our sleep? Well, I always say behavioral tools first, then look to nutrition, then, if necessary, look to supplementation, and then, if still necessary, look to prescription drugs obviously prescribed by a board certified physician. Well, we\\'ve talked a lot about the behavioral tools for critical period three. We have not talked a lot about the supplementation-based tools. There are supplements that for most people will greatly improve their ability to fall and stay asleep and the three main supplements in that category or that kit of sleep supplements, and I\\'ve talked about these before, are magnesium threonate, so T-H-R-E- O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, and theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine. Now, some important things to point out about mag threonate, as it\\'s called, apigenin, and theanine. First of all, you don\\'t necessarily need to take all three, although, many people get a synergistic effect from taking all three. In fact, you may not even need to take even one. What I recommend is that if you\\'re already doing all the behavioral tools regularly and you\\'re still having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep, well, then you might try one of the supplements within this sleep stack. They do have fairly wide margins for safety. Although, I should also say, anytime you\\'re going to add or remove something from your supplement protocol or your nutritional program, you definitely want to talk to your physician. I don\\'t just say that to protect us. I say that to protect you. But for most people, the margins of safety on these things are going to be pretty broad. A couple of notes about dosages. For some people, the dosages of any one or several of the supplements I mentioned will be zero. That is, you won\\'t need them in order to get and stay asleep most nights of your life. That\\'s terrific if you don\\'t need them. For many people, however, taking 145 milligrams of magnesium threonate can be very beneficial. That\\'s the dosage that most people will benefit from. Some people need to go a little higher. Some people need to go a little bit lower. One of the reasons that we\\'ve been pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations these days is because it allows people to adjust the dosage of one component of a so-called sleep stack without having to disrupt the dosage of another component, and so on. It also allows people to try just one element within the sleep stack without having to purchase and try the others, which is a problem if you\\'re buying a blend of a lot of different ingredients. So 145 milligrams of magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams of apigenin. And again, you could just take the apigenin on its own. And 100 to 400 milligrams of theanine taken, again, alone or in combination with the other supplements mentioned in the stack many people find allows them to get really drowsy and fall asleep, sleep really deeply, and they feel much more refreshed the next day and they don\\'t have a grogginess to them. Now, a couple of notes about these different supplements. About 5% of people report that magnesium threonate really disrupts their gut. It gives them diarrhea or gastric distress. In which case, don\\'t take it. If magnesium threonate disrupts your gut or your digestion to a point where it\\'s uncomfortable or at all and you don\\'t like it, don\\'t take any of it. The proper dosage for you, in other words, would be zero milligrams. Now, in a slightly different way, many people who can tolerate magnesium threonate or really thrive on magnesium threonate and like apigenin might find that theanine, even at the lowest dose of a hundred milligrams, \\'cause, again, the range is a hundred to 400 milligrams, that theanine gives them such vivid dreams that they actually find it disruptive where they wake up in the middle of the night or they find that the sleep that they\\'re getting is kind of anxiety ridden because of the intensity of those dreams. So some people might choose to leave theanine out of the sleep stack and just take magnesium threonate or apigenin And again, some people might leave magnesium threonate out of the sleep stack. Again, all of this is really about finding the supplementation protocol that\\'s ideal for you. I should mention that whether or not you\\'re taking one or two or three of the components of the sleep stack, the ideal time to take those is 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime, especially if you haven\\'t had anything to eat for the three hours or so before bedtime. I confess that oftentimes I\\'ll have a little bit of a snack late in the evening, some berries or something. I try not to eat too close to bedtime, but some evenings just because of work schedule, I\\'ll get home late, be 9:00 p.m., and I\\'ll eat a big meal and then I\\'ll take the sleep stack and fall asleep. Every once in a while, that just so happens. Nobody\\'s perfect. Certainly I\\'m not. But that sleep stack can be very beneficial. And I do think that it\\'s preferable to melatonin. Here\\'s the reason. First of all, melatonin is a hormone that you endogenously make. You now know a lot about melatonin and it\\'s controlled by light, meaning light inhibits it or eliminates it, darkness promotes it. And melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, but the dosages of melatonin that are contained in most commercial products is far, far, far greater than what we would make endogenously. So it\\'s really supraphysiological. So that\\'s of concern because melatonin is not just responsible for making us sleepy and fall asleep. It also does things like interacts with other hormone systems, testosterone and estrogen, even in the puberty system, in kids. Is taking melatonin every once in a while a problem for adjusting to jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. I would even say no. But taking it chronically over time, especially kids taking it chronically over time, can potentially be problematic. So at least in my opinion, these other supplements are going to be preferable to melatonin. Now, as I mentioned in the beginning of today\\'s episode, there are some other things that I certainly take every once in a while and that other people might consider taking in addition to the sleep stack I talked about before or in place of that sleep stack if that sleep stack doesn\\'t work well for them. So every third or fourth night, I will take two grams of glycine and a hundred milligrams of GABA in addition to the standard sleep stack that I talked about before. So I\\'m taking mag threonate, apigenin, and theanine, and then I will also take two grams of glycine and GABA, which I find greatly enhances my ability to get into sleep. But the reason I only add glycine and GABA every third or fourth night is that if I take it too often, I find that the entire sleep stack doesn\\'t work quite as effectively. I don\\'t know exactly why this is the case, but in any event, that\\'s what I do. And more recently, I\\'ve also started using inositol, in particular myo-inositol. Every other night, I\\'ll take 900 milligrams of myo- inositol in addition to mag threonate, apigenin, and theanine, and not on the nights when I take glycine and GABA. So I\\'m adding 900 milligrams of inositol to the standard sleep stack of mag threonate, theanine, and apigenin. And what I find is not only does it greatly enhance my ability to fall asleep quickly, but if I wake up in the middle of the night, which I often do to use the bathroom, I find it very, very easy to fall back asleep. Whereas when I don\\'t take inositol every other night or so, I find that if I wake up in the middle of the night, it\\'s a bit more of a challenge to fall back asleep. So inositol has a number of different uses that have been discussed in terms of mental health and in terms of adjusting anxiety for its daytime use. What I\\'m talking about is taking 900 milligrams of myo-inositol also 30 to 60 minutes before sleep along with the standard sleep stack and I found that to be immensely beneficial. I also noticed that it has a pretty long tail of anxiety suppression throughout the day. And I\\'m not somebody who suffers from anxiety, but I have to say it just has led me to feel a bit calmer throughout the day, and I don\\'t really know how to say this except in subjective terms, to feel a bit more buffered against or resilient against stress events. And if you look at the literature on inositol and its interactions with the serotonin system and other systems, that all makes sense as to why that would be the case. So we\\'ll provide links to our so-called sleep kit, which is part of our Neural Network Newsletter. It\\'s a zero-cost newsletter where you can access this information about supplements and other behavioral tools for sleep in list form. But that sleep kit doesn\\'t include some of the newer information that I\\'ve provided this episode, in particular, the information about inositol and what I\\'m finding to be the very beneficial use of inositol for the ability to fall back asleep after waking up in the middle of the night, which is something that a lot of people struggle with. Now, that\\'s supplementation for falling and staying asleep, but we can return to the behavioral tools also as powerful levers and tools for falling asleep and getting back to sleep. And again, we look to NSDR, non-sleep deep rest, or the Reveri app as a way to do that. As I mentioned earlier, the Reveri app has been developed on the basis of really high-quality, peer-reviewed research, both clinical and non-clinical, by my colleague, David Spiegel, who\\'s our associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford. It\\'s a wonderful tool. It does carry a cost after the initial seven-day trial. I can tell you what the cost on that is so you can get a sense because I do realize that anything that carries a cost, for some people, it won\\'t be accessible. Right now, Reveri, and I should just mention, they didn\\'t pay us for an ad read. I\\'m just telling you what they told me so that I can accurately report what it costs to use Reveri. They have a monthly subscription to use the Reveri app at 14.99. You do get the seven-day free trial. They have a yearly subscription of 99.99 with a seven-day free trial. And they have a lifetime purchase, one-time purchase, of 249 with no trial. It right now is only available for Apple, not for Android, but they are, yes, going to have it available for Android soon. There\\'s a signup list there. I should mention that while the cost might seem high, if you compare that cost to, say, supplements, or you compare that cost to a poor night\\'s sleep over time, the cost, at least to me, seems somewhat modest, certainly within range for a number of people. But I acknowledge not within range for other people, which is why I also want to point to zero-cost tools and the zero-cost tool for getting asleep, staying asleep, and falling back asleep is going to be NSDR. We\\'ll put a link to a non-sleep deep rest protocol that\\'s available on YouTube, so available to anybody zero cost provided you have a internet connection. Again, dim the screen if you\\'re going to turn that on late at night. And there are a number of other yoga nidra scripts and apps and sources around the internet, in particular, on YouTube, that are zero cost that you could use if the Reveri app is outside your price range or is not preferable to you, et cetera. When I wake up in the middle of the night, it\\'s usually to use the restroom. I\\'ll go use the restroom. I\\'ll keep the lights as dim as possible. I\\'ll get back into bed. And if I find that it\\'s easy to fall asleep, great, I\\'m asleep. And if not, then I will generally plug in the Reveri app. They have a fall back asleep hypnosis, and 99 times out of a hundred, I\\'m back asleep within minutes and I don\\'t wake up until morning. Now, very briefly, I just want to touch on some tools that are very commonly used by many people out there, and believe it or not, there is peer-reviewed science on things like eye masks. Do eye masks improve your ability to stay asleep? And indeed, they do, provided they are not too tight and provided that the room is cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover the upper half of your face, which is where glabrous skin is localized. Remember, palms of the hands, bottoms of the feet, glabrous skin on the face. So a lot of people who wear eye masks will wake up because they\\'re too warm if the room is too warm. So if you\\'re going to use an eye mask to keep light out, definitely make sure the room and your sleeping environment and your bed are cool enough in order for you to stay asleep. In addition, I get a lot of questions about earplugs. Here\\'s the deal with earplugs. Some people find that earplugs are very beneficial because, of course, they prevent the entrance of sound into the ear that could wake us up. But some people find that the sound of their own beating of their own heart can be disruptive and they get a sort of humming in their head when they have those earplugs in. I\\'m one such person. Although, I have family members that like using earplugs when they sleep. So it\\'s really up to you. You have to see whether or not those earplugs help or disrupt your sleep. For me, they\\'re no good. For some people, they really enjoy them. I don\\'t use an eye mask unless I\\'m sleeping in a really bright environment or I need to sleep on a plane and things of that sort. Other tools that I\\'ll just mention that have peer-reviewed research to support them. Elevating your feet either with a pillow or by elevating the end of your bed by about three to five degrees can be really beneficial for increasing the depth of sleep because of the so-called glymphatic washout. This is the movement of and circulation of fluids in your brain at night that lead to more wakefulness and actually can improve cognitive function and a number of other things related to brain health. There\\'s one caveat to that. For people that suffer from acid reflux, having your ankles elevated above your chest or above your heart in the middle of the night can actually exacerbate that acid reflux. You want to do the opposite. You want to actually elevate the head side of your bed by about three to five degrees. Now, one of the common causes of sleep disruption that has tremendously detrimental effects is so-called sleep apnea. So this is basically bouts of suffocation or lack of oxygenation during sleep. This is particularly the case for people that are very heavyset, and that heavyset could be from obesity, it could also be heavyset from having too much muscle. A lot of people who are carrying too much muscle will actually have sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea is actually very dangerous. It\\'s associated with a number of cardiovascular issues. It\\'s associated with sexual dysfunction. It\\'s associated with issues with cognition. Sleep apnea is bad. A lot of people will have to use the PAP, which is a, it\\'s a device. It looks like a sort of like a snorkel mask or a dive mask. It\\'s a whole apparatus that people will go to sleep with. However, many people can relieve themselves of sleep apnea provided it\\'s not too serious and can sleep much better, in fact, I think all people can sleep much better, if they train themselves to be nose breathers while they sleep. There are a lot of reasons to be a nose breather unless you are breathing very hard due to exercise or talking or eating. That was all covered in James Nestor\\'s book, \"Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art.\" It\\'s been covered in a number of different podcasts. We\\'ve talked about it on this podcast as well. It\\'s a good idea to be a nose breather unless you need to mouth breathe. And it\\'s a great idea, it\\'s a superb idea, to be a nose breather in sleep. And one way to really get good at that is to take a little bit of medical tape and to tape your mouth shut before going to sleep. You heard me right. Put some medical tape over your mouth and force yourself to nose breathe during sleep. It also prevents snoring in most cases. Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, being a very serious health concern. I should also mention as a tool that if you have a hard time being a nose breather in sleep, you can try doing your cardiovascular exercise, at least the lower-intensity cardiovascular exercise, through purely nasal breathing. And one way to do that, again, is to tape your mouth shut or put a gulp of water in your mouth, but don\\'t actually swallow that mouth full of water, or to use a mouthpiece or just deliberately keep your mouth closed and insist on breathing through your nose. Most people find that when they start doing cardiovascular exercise that way, it\\'s really challenging at first, but over time, they actually can feel quite calm and still can generate a lot of physical effort purely using nose breathing. The reason that doing nose breathing during cardiovascular exercise translates to being a nose breather during sleep is that your sinuses actually can dilate, they\\'re plastic, and over time, plastic meaning they\\'re malleable that is, and they can become wider. You\\'re not going to get giant nostrils. Don\\'t worry about it. Your airways within your skull, \\'cause that\\'s what the sinuses really are, these little passages within the skull, and, of course, within the nasal passages, will dilate and will allow you to breathe more easily through your nose. But for those of you that are waking up in the middle of the night breathing on your back [breathing heavily] or your partner is telling you that or other people are telling you that or you\\'re that person on the plane with your mouth hanging open and drooling and your mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible for health reasons and other reasons, put some a medical tape over your mouth, learn to be a nose breather during sleep. Your sleep will improve and your daytime feelings of wakefulness and focus will improve, your cardiovascular health will improve, and on and on and on. So now we\\'ve largely covered the tools that one could use to get and stay asleep, and we talked about exercise, we talked about temperature, we talked about supplements, and we talked about, of course, keeping the sleeping environment both cool and as dark as possible. I do want to mention a couple of broad contour tools that will impact your ability to sleep really well on a consistent basis and the one that impacts the most number of people is weekends. Turns out that most everybody feels the impulse to sleep in on the weekend, especially if they\\'ve been out late the night before. However, the data show that keeping relatively consistent sleep and wake times is really going to enhance the quality and depth of your sleep. So if you stay out late one night, sure, you might allow yourself to sleep in an extra hour or so, but you should really try to avoid sleeping in longer than an hour beyond your normal wake-up time. That\\'s right. If you normally get eight hours of sleep and you wake up at 7:00 a.m., probably okay to wake up at 8:00 a.m. on the weekend or after a night out the night before, but try not to sleep until 11 or noon thinking that you\\'re going to catch up on your sleep or that\\'s better than waking up at a consistent time. It would be better to wake up at a consistent time plus or minus an hour and get a nap in the afternoon provided that nap, again, isn\\'t too long. And the other tool that relates to nights that you stayed out too late or that you feel like you want to sleep in a bit more in the morning is if you are going to wake up at your consistent time. So for example, normally you go to bed at 10 and you wake up at six. Let\\'s say that\\'s your schedule. And you end up staying up late one night until midnight or one for whatever reason and the next morning you wake up at seven and you\\'re still groggy. In that case, you absolutely want to wait to ingest caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking. You really do because there are good data to support the fact that caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes, that\\'s obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep if you take it too late in the day. That\\'s very obvious as to why that would be the case. But caffeine especially disrupts what\\'s called compensatory sleep. So if you start changing your waking time and your to sleep time and you start using additional caffeine to offset the sleepiness that you\\'re experiencing because of those late nights out, well, that\\'s when you really start to disrupt not just your nighttime sleep, but your daytime compensatory sleep, so those naps. You also are disrupting the total architecture of sleep in the early morning hours. There\\'s a lot of great science that\\'s been put to this, or that\\'s emerged from this, I should say. So try and keep those sleep-wake times relatively constant plus or minus an hour, and try as much as you can to delay that caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes after waking every day, but especially on days where you wake up and you feel you haven\\'t gotten enough sleep. In that case, I highly recommend you just use NSDR or the Reveri app or some other form of deep relaxation to try and compensate for the lack of sleep, knowing, of course, that there\\'s no complete compensation for lack of sleep. There are just things that we can do to partially offset lack of sleep. Now, a couple of final points and additional tools that I think are going to be useful to everybody, in particular, people who have young children or are following a shift work schedule or who are experiencing jet lag. Keep in mind, jet lag can be due to travel, which is obvious, but jet lag can also be due to getting woken up in the middle of the night, right? Your body doesn\\'t know the difference between flying to a new time zone and getting woken up in the middle of the night. The tool that I\\'d like to offer you is an understanding of something called temperature minimum. And I\\'m going to make this as simple as possible and I\\'m confident that everyone can understand this even if you don\\'t have any science background. Here\\'s the question you need to ask yourself. What is your typical wake-up time, okay? What\\'s your typical wake-up time? If for you, your typical wake-up time is 7:00 a.m. plus or minus half an hour, and that could be 7:00 a.m. because you set an alarm clock or it could be 7:00 a.m. because you naturally wake up at 7:00 a.m., doesn\\'t matter, if your typical wake-up time most days is 7:00 a.m., well, then your temperature minimum is 5:00 a.m. That\\'s right, your temperature minimum is not a temperature. It\\'s a time within your 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours before your typical wake-up time, your body is at its lowest temperature that it will ever be in the 24- hour cycle. That\\'s why it\\'s called your temperature minimum. Here\\'s what you need to know about your temperature minimum. If you view bright light, exercise, or drink caffeine or all of the above in the two to four hours before your temperature minimum, that will delay your clock. What that means when I say delay your clock is it will make you want to go to sleep later and wake up later the next night, okay? So let\\'s run this exercise for you, the person waking up at 7:00 a.m. on a regular basis, I can predict with almost certainty that your body is going to be at its lowest temperature at 5:00 a.m.. So what that means is that if you get up at 3:00 a.m. or at 4:00 a.m. and you flip on bright lights in your house or in your bathroom or you have a cup of coffee or you do any kind of exercise or you get up and head to the airport, the mechanisms in your brain and body that control timing of sleep and timing of waking will shift. They will delay. It\\'s as if you put your clock on hold for a little while and then let it start again, okay? That\\'s the simplest way I can describe it. And you will tend to want to go to sleep later and wake up later the following night. Now, the opposite is true if you view bright light, drink caffeine, or exercise or socialize, I should say, in the hours immediately after your temperature minimum. So for you in this example, the person who\\'s waking up at 7:00 a.m., your temperature minimum is 5:00 a.m., if you view bright light, exercise, maybe have a snack, maybe not, or socialize, move about, at 5:30 or 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m. That will tend to phase advance your clock. It will tend to basically make you want to go to bed earlier and wake up earlier the following night. Now, I used this example of a person who wakes up typically at 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum is 5:00 a.m., but, of course, you need to adjust that for yourself if you\\'re somebody who wakes up at 9:00 a.m. or at 5:00 a.m. et cetera. Why do I offer this as a tool? Well, this is an immensely powerful tool if, for instance, you are headed to a time zone where you need to go to bed earlier and wake up earlier once you arrive in that time zone. What it means is in the day or two before you leave, you can force yourself to exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even to eat a meal early in the morning, or maybe you still fast early in the morning and that\\'s really up to you, but you force yourself to do the activities that are going to phase advance your clock. Whereas if you\\'re traveling to a time zone where you are going to need to go to sleep much later and you\\'re going to need to wake up much later or even a little bit later, you can do those things in the hours prior to your temperature minimum. Now, for those of you that work shift work, this can be especially useful, but I want to say a couple of things about shift work. There are a lot of details about shift work and jet lag in an episode that I did specifically about jet lag and shift work. So for the deep dive, go there, but suffice to say this for now, if you are going to do shift work, try to stay on the same shift for two weeks at a time. It\\'s very detrimental to brain and body, it can even be horrifically challenging for your brain and body in a number of ways, if you are switching on the so-called swing shift, you know, you\\'re working three days the night shift, three days the day shift, three days the night shift, three days the... Try and stay on the same schedule as much as possible. And I should say for everybody, people who are jet lagged and engaged in shift work or not, but just for everybody, if you need to be awake in the middle of your sleep cycle and it\\'s not just a quick departure to the bathroom and back to bed, but you really need to be awake, you know, you\\'re feeding a baby or you\\'re taking care of a loved one or you need to do something that\\'s critical or you need to work, if possible, use red light, okay? Now, for shift workers who really are trying to stay awake all night and sleep all day, this is not going to be ideal, but for people that, for instance, need to stay up really late one night or wake up especially early, like 3:00 a.m., to prepare for an exam that you\\'re just not ready for or to head to the airport, et cetera, using red light has been shown to allow people to be awake enough and obviously see what they need to see in order to perform their activities safely but it does not seem to disrupt the cortisol rhythm that is the healthy, normal cortisol rhythm. Now, I realize this is kind of an advanced tool and many people won\\'t have access to this. There are a number of different sources for red lights now. Companies like Joovv or KOZE light. These are different brands. I don\\'t have any affiliation to any of these brands, I should say. There are a number of different red light bulb sources out there and commercial sources that you can explore if you want. But understanding this temperature minimum is really powerful because it allows you to adjust your schedule depending on travel, depending on changing work schedules or school schedules. And if you\\'re not a morning person, you can use the tools related to temperature minimum to really become a morning person over time, and it actually is pretty easy. And I talked about this in a previous episode but I\\'ll just mention that there have been shown to be important, positive effects on cognition, on even grip strength and physical performance, for people that are early morning risers, and that\\'s especially true for night owls that deliberately shift themselves to become early risers. Okay, so that\\'s a lot of information and a lot of tools and I suppose the one set of tools that I really didn\\'t drill into too deeply, the ones related to jet lag and shift work. And again, please check out the episode on jet lag and shift work if that\\'s relevant to you. But I think for most people who are going to sleep at night and are trying their best to sleep well at night and are trying their best to wake up in the morning at whatever hour and stay alert and focused throughout the day, maybe with a brief nap, the tools that I talked about today related to light, temperature, food, exercise, caffeine, supplements, and digital tools, I\\'m hoping will prove to be very useful for you. They certainly are all supported by excellent peer-reviewed research. And I should just emphasize again that most of the tools we talked about are completely zero cost. So while the supplements and some of the digital tools do carry some cost to them, I really want to encourage everybody to get your behaviors right. Get all of the things related to your timing of exercise and type of exercise in the best possible order and time of day. We talked about this critical period early in the day and then another critical period in the middle of the day and the late afternoon and then this third critical period in the middle of the night. Different tools for the different three critical periods. I promise that if you start to implement some, or ideally, all of these tools, the quality of your sleep will increase tremendously. And of course, in doing so, the quality of your daytime alertness and your ability to focus will improve tremendously. Again, sleep is the absolute foundation of your mental health, your physical health, and your performance in all endeavors. So if there\\'s one area of your life to really focus on and try and optimize, if your goal is to be happier and more productive and just to have a better life overall, 01:39:26 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Huberman Lab Clips, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter I can confidently say that sleep is really the thing to optimize.

Our premium channel was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which still comes out once a week every Monday and, of course, is zero cost to consumer. The premium channel is also designed to support exciting research being done at major universities like Stanford and elsewhere, research that\\'s done on humans that should lead to protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance in the near future. If you\\'d like to check out the premium channel subscription model, you can go to hubermanlab.com/premium, and there you can subscribe for $10 a month or $100 a year. We also have a lifetime subscriber option. For those of you that are already Huberman Lab podcast premium subscribers and you\\'re watching and/or hearing this, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium and download the premium podcast feed. And for those of you that are not already Huberman Lab premium podcast subscribers, you will be able to hear the first 15 minutes or so of this episode, and hopefully, that will allow you to discern whether or not you would like to become a premium subscriber. Without further ado, let\\'s get to answering your questions. And as always, I will strive to be as accurate as possible, as thorough as possible, and yet, as concise as possible. Our first question is about motivation, in particular, how to maintain motivation over long periods of time. This was the question asked by Martin Zokov. He wrote, \"I alternate between periods of two different states that vary from a few weeks to a couple of months. I have extremely high motivation in one state, where I can do multiple things-- side projects, making music, as well as my main things, or really low- motivational states, where I can barely do anything, and I only look for short term entertainment.\" I\\'m guessing, short-term entertainment comes in the form of video games, social media, and just doing generally unproductive things, as we all do from time to time. He goes on to write, \"What would be the best set of protocols to normalize those extremes into a more stable and consistent state?\" Well, first off, this is an excellent question. I say that because it\\'s a question that I hear a lot, and I think that many people are interested in knowing how motivated they ought to feel. And I think a lot of people also feel a lot less motivated than they would like. Now, here the question was, specifically, about how to not go from these extremes of days or weeks of high motivation to days or weeks of low motivation. But before we do that, we need to take a step back and acknowledge that, just as with anxiety, or happiness, or sadness, we as human beings don\\'t have an objective window into how other people experience motivation. In fact, most of the time, we don\\'t even realize how we experience motivation. We just know whether or not we feel a high barrier or a low barrier to leaning into work and getting things done. In fact, I have a good friend who did many years in the special operations community, and then went on to the finance community, and then now works in health and wellness community. He has a great mental image for all of us to adopt. It\\'s certainly one that I\\'ve adopted, which is-- for anything in our life, we can either be back on our heels, flat footed, or forward center of mass. Back in our heels, meaning really struggling; flat footed, meaning we\\'re doing OK; or forward center of mass, meaning that we feel as if we\\'re really tackling things and that we are in control of our environment or at least to some degree. So I place that imagery in your mind because I\\'ll return to it a little bit later in the question when we get into some of the underlying circuitry and tools. In the meantime, I want to remind everybody what the basis of motivation is. There are many neurochemicals and neural circuits involved in what we call motivation, but a central theme of the neuroscience of motivation is that the neural modulator dopamine is involved. Now, dopamine does other things besides control motivation. In fact, it controls light adaptation in the retina, that is your eye. It controls a number of different things in terms of movement. It controls all sorts of things, but it is strongly related to the motivation pathways. How do we know that? Well, there are experiments on animals and humans, which show that even in the absence of dopamine, or in the presence of very low dopamine, I should say, people and animals can still experience pleasure. However, when dopamine levels are too low, people\\'s ability to pursue pleasure, or their willingness to pursue pleasure, in particular, their willingness to undergo effort to pursue pleasure or any goal of any kind, not just pleasure, any goal of any kind, is strongly regulated by the levels of dopamine. So if dopamine levels are too low, people simply will not put in the effort to obtain or reach a goal. If dopamine levels are adequately high, they will put in that effort. And if dopamine levels go too high, you actually see something that is pathologic, which is that people consider every goal a reasonable goal. This is often seen in the manic phase of a manic bipolar person. So for instance, somebody with manic bipolar who is in a manic episode, dopamine levels are very, very high, and they will think every idea is a great idea. And they will have tons of energy to do that, so much so so that they\\'re not sleeping. So obviously, that\\'s not what we want. What we want, and what the question asker, Martin, is asking about, is how to keep dopamine levels in a range that allow us to lean into effort but that we don\\'t expend our ability to stay motivated. And we can really trace that back to a biochemical/neural circuit statement, which is-- we really want to control our output of dopamine and the baseline levels of dopamine from which that output is taken. In other words, we want to think about dopamine as a reservoir or residing in a reservoir. That reservoir can be depleted, so it\\'s exhaustible, it\\'s depletable, but it\\'s renewable as well. And one of the best analogies that I\\'ve ever heard was by a previous guest on the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Kyle Gillett, who\\'s a medical doctor, obesity specialist, expert in hormones. We did an episode on optimizing hormones in males with Dr. Kyle Gillett. You can find that at hubermanlab.com or anywhere you can find podcasts. Dr. Gillett offered an analogy of the baseline levels of dopamine as a wave pool, and I really like this. So if you think about this pool full of dopamine-- and here we\\'re just talking about the dopamine that resides in the circuits of the brain that control motivation. But that pool of dopamine you could imagine is just sitting there not doing much of anything while you\\'re asleep. In fact, while you\\'re sleeping, you\\'re replenishing those dopamine levels. I\\'ll tell you another tool in a moment to replenish those dopamine levels. But if you were to pursue a goal, really, really go forward-center of mass for many, many hours or many, many days, in some cases, and pursue a goal or multiple goals and you\\'re really driven to do a ton, what you\\'re effectively doing is generating waves in that wave pool. And if those waves are too big, well, then the waves can\\'t keep repeating themselves. So think about the wave as the motivation and the depth of the pool is the reservoir of dopamine. And if those waves are too big, too much excitement, too much motivation, too much center of mass for a given period of time, then the water in this wave pool sloshes out of the wave pool lowering the reservoir. And then there are really three ways that you can replenish that reservoir, and you want to maintain or replenish that reservoir if it\\'s been depleted. How do you do that? Well, first of all, quality sleep. So when I say quality, I mean where you\\'re getting enough slow wave sleep and rapid I move in sleep. So for some people, six hours, for some people, eight hours. Some people might even need a little bit more or a little bit less. We have episodes-- the Perfect Your Sleep episode, the Master Your Sleep episode. We have a toolkit for sleep. All available at zero cost at hubermanlab.com, links et cetera. So check those out for getting your sleep right. But sleep is really when you replenish that reservoir of dopamine. So you cannot ignore sleep. I\\'ll come back to this in a moment. The second science supported tool that\\'s really been shown to replenish dopamine, in particular, dopamine within the pathways that regulate motivation, is a practice I\\'ve talked about before on the podcast called non-sleep deep rest, sometimes called yoga nidra, although, yoga nidra is a little bit different. There are two studies out of Denmark that have explored yoga nidra in the context of dopamine. The first one simply involved having people do a yoga nidra practice. Again, this doesn\\'t involve any movement, but it involves people, potentially you, doing anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes, although there are now data showing that as short as 10 minutes of a non-sleep deep rest, a.k.a. yoga nidra protocol, leads to dramatic, really dramatic increases in striatal dopamine reserves. So it essentially is replenishing the dopamine reserve pool. This is why I\\'m such a fan of using NSDR, a.k.a. yoga nidra, at least once a day and especially under times when you\\'re engaging in a lot of high output. (Yoga Nidra Ebook & paperback) And when I say, especially at times when you\\'re engaging in a lot of high output, this is a mistake many people make. They push, push, push, push, push. They\\'re in pursuit of a goal. Then they hit that point where they\\'re exhausted. Then they start doing all the dopamine reserve pool replenishing tools such as yoga nidra or NSDR. The real key is to always tap off that or refill that reservoir once a day before it\\'s completely depleted. Now, this gets into some of the biochemistry of dopamine and the relevant circuits, but it takes a lot longer to restore the dopamine reservoir-- think of it still as a wave pool, but that reservoir from a place of complete depletion then it does of partial depletion. So there\\'s an asymmetry in the way this is done. So it\\'s not as if you drink a glass of water. You fill the glass of water at a certain rate and it fills up to a certain level, and the rate is constant. Think about it as once the level of dopamine in your reserve is depleted past a certain point, it takes a lot more effort, much more sleep, much more NSDR, things of that sort to replenish that reservoir. Now, oftentimes what people will do when they start feeling less motivation is they will start relying on things like Adderall, Ritalin, some cases illegal substances that can increase dopamine. You know what those are. Please don\\'t ever lean in to those. They are extremely dangerous. They really are because of their ability to potently release dopamine. And guess what, deplete that reservoir even further. We\\'ve talked about some supplements on the podcast that can replenish dopamine, L-tyrosine in particular. Mucuna pruriens is actually 99% l-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine. I don\\'t necessarily recommend Mucuna pruriens. It tends to make people very dopaminergic-- drive, drive, drive, drive, motivated, and then crash. Again, depleting that pool. L-tyrosine is a little bit milder. But I really encourage people to lean first on the behavioral tools such as an NSDR. And by the way, there\\'s a NSDR script, totally zero cost, that you can find by putting my name and NSDR into YouTube. That one works quite well if you are looking for a short NSDR. There are some other NSDRs. You can simply look on the internet or YouTube and just put NSDR and you\\'ll find NSDR. Or if you prefer to do the more classic yoga nidra type approach, there are a lot of different yoga nidra options to choose from on YouTube. Many people think NSDR or yoga nidra are simply meditation with a body scan. That\\'s not true. Meditation is a focus exercise. Most meditations are focus exercise. NSDR restores energy through the dopamine system, and newer data are starting to show that it can actually recover lost sleep, so if you\\'re not sleeping enough. But to return to NSDR, a.k.a. yoga nidra, as a practice, yes, it\\'s been shown in laboratory studies, in humans, by the way, to restore dopamine levels. There\\'s another study, lesser known, from that same group that was published in 2011, which is entitled Dopaminergic stimulation enhances confidence and accuracy in seeing rapidly presented words. This was a cognitive task. They explored yoga nedra, a.k.a. NSDR, in the context of increasing striatal dopamine. They already knew that it did that, so that\\'s great. They confirmed that result. But what they also found is that doing NSDR could restore confidence in cognitive ability and performance in these cognitive tasks. So this is a really powerful, zero cost tool for re-upping or replenishing that dopamine reserve. So this is something to do every day, especially when you\\'re not feeling depleted. So the question, again, was about how to make sure that you don\\'t go through these cycles of extreme motivation and then lesser motivation. Well, get your sleep right. I always say, 80% or more of the nights of your life, hopefully the nights that it\\'s not good, are for good reasons that you\\'re enjoying yourself. But hey, life happens, so 100% of the time it\\'s just not reasonable to expect of yourself. Do NSDR once a day for either 10 minutes. If you have the time to do 20-30 minutes or an hour, you will see even more positive effects. It has been shown in these research studies to replenish dopamine, levels of confidence, cognitive ability, et cetera, and sense of motivation. And I said there were three tools, and the third tool that really can allow you to keep the dopamine, a.k.a. motivation circuitry, tuned up properly is to really start paying attention to peaks in dopamine and be very careful about layering in too many things that can stimulate the dopamine system. I talked about this quite a bit in the episode that we did on ADHD and building and maintaining focus. There are many things out there nowadays that will deplete the dopamine system. For instance-- and by the way, none of what I\\'m about to list is necessarily bad. I actually used some of these things. For instance, caffeine will increase dopamine receptors that will allow whatever dopamine is available to be more potent. OK, so caffeine is great for some people, less good for people with anxiety. Don\\'t drink it too late in the day because it will interfere with your sleep, and so on and so forth. But many people will combine caffeine with music that they particularly like. Music\\'s great. Music can stimulate dopamine release, we know this. It can enhance motivation, especially if is the kind of music that really puts you in the groove for the particular type of work you\\'re going to do. For me, I like to listen to either loud fast music or Glenn Gould classical piano, so one or the other. I know what\\'s right for me for a given time. You\\'ll know what\\'s right for you for a given time and your preferences. But what will happen is people will start consuming caffeine at higher and higher levels. Again, caffeine isn\\'t necessarily bad, but they\\'ll start doing that. And they\\'ll start layering it in, or stacking, very potent music, potent for them, plus things like L-tyrosine (L-tyrosine supplement). Again, none of these things are terrible on their own. In fact, they can be very beneficial. Sometimes they\\'ll start taking Mucuna pruriens. Sometimes they\\'ll start relying on things like Adderall, Ritalin. And pretty soon what\\'s happening is they\\'re getting these big waves in that dopamine wave pool, big peaks. And within a few days or maybe even within a few hours, they\\'re depleted and they\\'re at that low. And then, as Dr. Anna Lembke, who is a guest on the podcast, talked about in terms of addiction but also in her wonderful book Dopamine Nation, what happens is after those big peaks in dopamine, the reservoir, the baseline in dopamine, drops below its initial level. So it\\'s as if the reservoir got deeper, and it\\'s emptier, and it takes much, much longer to fill. So to be quite specific, what I\\'m recommending is get your sleep right. Ideally, every night of your life, but for as many nights of your life as possible. That\\'s clearly replenishing dopamine and sense of motivation. Do all the things associated with that-- morning, sunlight, lack of artificial light at certain hours of the night, et cetera. All of that\\'s in the Toolkit for Sleep and other episodes I mentioned before. Have a practice that is research supported to replenish dopamine, and incorporate that practice any time of day. Again, NSDR can be done morning, afternoon, or evening, or middle of the night if you wake up and you need to get back to sleep, it can be very beneficial for that. But do it as a consistent practice so that dopamine reservoir remains tapped off. And as a third point, please be wary of, or at least aware of, these peaks in dopamine and the fact that layering in a lot of things that stimulate dopamine, well, that can be wonderful for your wedding, birth of a new child, going to a sports event with a bunch of friends, celebrating a big anniversary. Yes, please do celebrate and enjoy the wonderful events of life, but please also understand and expect there will be a lull, a sort of postpartum low, maybe not full blown depression, that follows that unless you incorporate some tools and practices to replenish that dopamine. Does that mean you should never combine caffeine, L-tyrosine, music, and a workout, and time with friends? No, absolutely not. But don\\'t expect to do that, and then go do an intense bout of work, and then get up the next morning and do it all over again for more than a few days before you find yourself pretty depleted. So rather than give you a specific schedule of do seven days of this and four days of this, what I encourage you to do is, for at least five days a week-- maybe give yourself some time off on the weekends, maybe not. But for at least five days a week, get into a consistent routine that is, I should say, neurobiologically consistent as well with how the dopamine, a.k.a. circuits that control motivation, work. And I assure you that you will find yourself in a more regular groove of focus, and attention, and alertness, and motivation when you need to. And provided you\\'re doing all the things I described, and hopefully paying attention to other things like nutrition and social connection too, of course, you\\'ll find a much more even pattern of motivation over time. One last thing before I conclude the answer to this question. When I was in graduate school, I got some wonderful advice from an excellent neurologist. His name is Robert Knight. He used to be at University of California, Berkeley. I think he\\'s retired now but is still active in the scientific community. And I asked him what he was doing that weekend. I don\\'t know why this came up. And he said, oh, I\\'m going fishing. I like mindless recreation. I said, that\\'s great. You know, fishing is fun. I\\'m not particularly into fishing myself, but I\\'ve done it a few times and I enjoy it. And he said, the most important thing for a science or medicine career or any demanding career? I said, what? I was all ears, super hungry to get in the mix and do research and publish papers. And he said, figure out how many hours a day you can do real work consistently. That means five days a week, for some people six or seven, but five days a week I think for most people is going to be a bit healthier overall for your social life and family, et cetera. And he said, figure that out, and know that that number is what you should apply over, and over, and over again, but update that number about every four or five years. And I said, OK, so does that mean that over time I\\'m working more and more or less and less? And he said, ah, here\\'s the deal-- as you get better at your profession, you will find that you can do more potent work, more directed work, in a shorter amount of time, but that does not mean that you can continue to expand the amount of time that you\\'re doing focused work. In fact, the opposite. So this follows a sort of general principle that\\'s also present in resistance training, weightlifting, right? The analogy there is that people always imagine that as you get better and better at resistance training that you should do more and more volume, just keep adding volume. And there\\'s some evidence to support that. More volume for hypertrophy as opposed to less, et cetera. We\\'ve done episodes on this. However, there\\'s a different school of thought that works exceedingly well, and it runs in the exact opposite direction, which is as you get better at controlling muscular contractions-- or let\\'s say for in an endurance sport, as you get better at regulating your stride, and breathing, and all those things, you actually can do more \"adaptation\" stimulating damage during a given training session. So you want to train less not more over time because beginners don\\'t actually have the ability to get much done in a lot of time or a short period of time, whereas, experts can come in there and really nail it. So I think that advice that Robert Knight was really key, and it\\'s something that I\\'ve followed throughout my career. So at one period of my life, I won\\'t mention the hours that I worked in graduate school, they were pretty insane to be honest. I had family members get a little concerned. I actually lived in the laboratory even as a junior professor. I don\\'t suggest people do that by the way, but I enjoyed it at the time. And the key thing is that you figure out what you can do consistently and still maintain mental health and physical health. That\\'s key as well. And do that, and then, every couple of years or so, update that, typically, by reducing the total amount of time that you\\'re doing that high-potency work. I think that, combined with the other tools that I described before for generating ongoing dopaminergic circuits, keeping that reservoir full, ought to give you consistent motivation. Again, it\\'s an art, and a practice, and a science, so don\\'t expect to get it perfect the first time around. But I wish you all luck, and I\\'m certain that these tools work. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel, it\\'s really twofold. First of all, it\\'s to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which, of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. And to fund research. In particular, research done on human beings, so not animal models but on human beings, which I think we all agree as a species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels. Not just the premium channel but through all channels-- Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, and especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they\\'re going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you\\'d like to sign up for the Huberman Lab premium channel, again, there\\'s a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMA\\'s. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions, and you\\'ll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMA\\'s and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere. And again, you\\'ll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that\\'s hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
